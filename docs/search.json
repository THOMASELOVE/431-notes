Use the table of contents on the left side of the screen to navigate between chapters, or use the right side to navigate within the current chapter.\nYou can also search the document, using an automated index.\nAny of the code provided in the document can be copied to the clipboard using the Copy icon at the top right of the code block.\nThe document will be updated (unpredictably) throughout the semester.\n\n\n\nThese Notes provide a series of examples using R to work through issues that are likely to come up in PQHS/CRSP/MPHP 431. What you will mostly find are brief explanations of a key idea or summary, accompanied (most of the time) by R code and a demonstration of the results of applying that code.\nWhile these Notes share some of the features of a textbook, they are neither comprehensive nor completely original. The main purpose is to give 431 students a set of common materials on which to draw during the course. In class, we will sometimes:\n\nreiterate points made in this document,\namplify what is here,\nsimplify the presentation of things done here,\nuse new examples to show some of the same techniques,\nrefer to issues not mentioned in this document,\n\nbut what we don’t do is follow these notes very precisely. We assume instead that you will read the materials and try to learn from them, just as you will attend classes and try to learn from them. We welcome feedback of all kinds on this document or anything else.\n\n\n\nThe online home for Dr. Love’s 431 course in Fall 2022 is\nhttps://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/.\nGo there for all information related to the course.\nAll of the code and text in these Notes is posted online as HTML, and it is also possible to download PDF and ePub versions of the document from the down arrow next to the title (Notes for 431) at the top left of this screen. All data and R code related to these notes are also available to you through our course web site.\nBy the end of the semester, you will also have access to the Quarto files which generate everything in the document, including all of the R results. Quarto is a souped-up version of R Markdown, which you will use during the semester to complete your assignments, and which I used to develop previous versions of these notes. We will demonstrate the use of R Markdown and RStudio (the “program” we use to interface with the R language) in class."

In 431, we learn how to get things done.\n\nWe get people working with R and R Studio and R Markdown, even if they are completely new to coding. A gentle introduction is provided at Ismay and Kim (2022)\nWe learn how to use the tidyverse (http://www.tidyverse.org/), an array of tools in R (mostly developed by Hadley Wickham and his colleagues at R Studio) which share an underlying philosophy to make data science faster, easier, more reproducible and more fun. A critical text for understanding the tidyverse is Wickham and Grolemund (2022). Tidyverse tools facilitate:\n\nimporting data into R, which can be the source of intense pain for some things, but is really quite easy 95% of the time with the right tool.\ntidying data, that is, storing it in a format that includes one row per observation and one column per variable. This is harder, and more important, than you might think.\ntransforming data, perhaps by identifying specific subgroups of interest, creating new variables based on existing ones, or calculating summaries.\nvisualizing data to generate actual knowledge and identify questions about the data - this is an area where R really shines, and we’ll start with it in class.\nmodeling data, taking the approach that modeling is complementary to visualization, and allows us to answer questions that visualization helps us identify.\nand last, but definitely not least, communicating results, models and visualizations to others, in a way that is reproducible and effective.\n\nSome programming/coding is an inevitable requirement to accomplish all of these aims. If you are leery of coding, you’ll need to get past that, with the help of this course and our stellar teaching assistants. Getting started is always the most challenging part, but our experience is that most of the pain of developing these new skills evaporates by early October."

The middle of the distribution at later Ages is pretty consistent at at a Height somewhere between 150 and 175. The units aren’t specified, but we expect they must be centimeters. The Ages are clearly reported in Years.\nNo Age is reported over 80, and it appears that there is a large cluster of Ages at 80. This may be due to a requirement that Ages 80 and above be reported at 80 so as to help mask the identity of those individuals.2\n\nAs in this case, we’re going to build most of our visualizations using tools from the ggplot2 package, which is part of the tidyverse series of packages. You’ll see similar coding structures throughout this Chapter, most of which are covered as well in Chapter 3 of Wickham and Grolemund (2022)."

This includes various methods of organizing and graphing data to get an idea of what those data can tell us.\nAs Vittinghoff et al. (2012) suggest, the nature of the measurement determines how best to describe it statistically, and the main distinction is between numerical and categorical variables. Even this is a little tricky - plenty of data can have values that look like numerical values, but are just numerals serving as labels.\nAs Bock, Velleman, and De Veaux (2004) point out, the truly critical notion, of course, is that data values, no matter what kind, are useless without their contexts. The Five W’s (Who, What [and in what units], When, Where, Why, and often How) are just as useful for establishing the context of data as they are in journalism. If you can’t answer Who and What, in particular, you don’t have any useful information.\nIn general, each row of a data frame corresponds to an individual (respondent, experimental unit, record, or observation) about whom some characteristics are gathered in columns (and these characteristics may be called variables, factors or data elements.) Every column / variable should have a name that indicates what it is measuring, and every row / observation should have a name that indicates who is being measured."

    "text": "4.3 Sampling Adults in NHANES\nIn Chapter 3, we spent some time with a sample from the National Health and Nutrition Examination. Now, by changing the value of the set.seed function which determines the starting place for the random sampling, and changing some other specifications, we’ll generate a new sample describing 750 unique (distinct) adult subjects who completed the 2011-12 version of the survey when they were between the ages of 21 and 64.\n\n4.3.1 Creating a Temporary, Cleaner Data Frame\nI’ll start by describing the plan we will use to create a new data frame called nh_temp from which we will eventually build our final sample. In particular, let me lay out the steps I will use to create the nh_temp frame from the original NHANES data frame available in the R package called NHANES.\n\nWe’ll filter the original NHANES data frame to include only the responses from the 2011-12 administration of the survey. This will cut the sample in half, from 10,000 rows to 5,000.\nWe’ll then filter again to restrict the sample to adults whose age is at least 21 and also less than 65. I’ll do this because I want to avoid problems with including both children and adults in my sample, and because I also want to focus on the population of people in the US who are usually covered by private insurance from their job, or by Medicaid insurance from the government, rather than those covered by Medicare.\nAs we discussed previously, what is listed in the NHANES data frame as Gender should be more correctly referred to as Sex. Sex is a biological feature of an individual, while Gender is a social construct. This is an important distinction, so I’ll change the name of the variable.\nWe’ll also rename three other variables, specifically we’ll use Race to describe the Race3 variable in the original NHANES data frame, as well as SBP to refer to the average systolic blood pressure, which is specified as BPSysAve, and DBP to refer to the average diastolic blood pressure, which is specified as BPDiaAve.\nHaving accomplished the previous four steps, we’ll then select the variables we want to keep in the sample. (We use select for choosing variables or columns in the data frame, and filter for selecting subjects or rows.) The sixteen variables we will select are: ID, Sex, Age, Height, Weight, Race, Education, BMI, SBP, DBP, Pulse, PhysActive, Smoke100, SleepTrouble, MaritalStatus and HealthGen.\nThe original NHANES data frame includes some subjects (rows) multiple times in an effort to incorporate some of the sampling weights used in most NHANES analyses. For our purposes, though, we’d like to only include each subject one time. We use the distinct() function to limit the data frame to completely unique subjects (so that, for example, we don’t wind up with two or more rows that have the same ID number.)\n\nHere is the code I used to complete the six steps listed above and create the nh_temp data frame.\n\nnh_temp <- NHANES |>\n    filter(SurveyYr == \"2011_12\") |>\n    filter(Age >= 21 & Age < 65) |>\n    rename(Sex = Gender, Race = Race3, SBP = BPSysAve, DBP = BPDiaAve) |>\n    select(ID, Sex, Age, Height, Weight, Race, Education, BMI, SBP, DBP, \n           Pulse, PhysActive, Smoke100, SleepTrouble, \n           MaritalStatus, HealthGen) |>\n   distinct()\n\nThe resulting nh_temp data frame has 1700 rows and 16 columns.\n\nnh_temp\n\n# A tibble: 1,700 × 16\n      ID Sex     Age Height Weight Race  Educa…¹   BMI   SBP   DBP Pulse PhysA…²\n   <int> <fct> <int>  <dbl>  <dbl> <fct> <fct>   <dbl> <int> <int> <int> <fct>  \n 1 62172 fema…    43   172    98.6 Black High S…  33.3   103    72    80 No     \n 2 62176 fema…    34   172.   68.7 White Colleg…  23.3   107    69    92 Yes    \n 3 62180 male     35   179.   89   White Colleg…  27.9   107    66    66 No     \n 4 62199 male     57   186    96.9 White Colleg…  28     110    65    84 Yes    \n 5 62205 male     28   171.   84.8 White Colleg…  28.9   122    87    70 Yes    \n 6 62206 fema…    35   167.   81.5 White Some C…  29.1   106    50    58 No     \n 7 62208 male     38   169.   63.2 Hisp… Some C…  22.2   105    59    52 Yes    \n 8 62209 fema…    62   143.   53.5 Mexi… 8th Gr…  26     108    57    72 No     \n 9 62220 fema…    31   167.  113.

    "section": "4.4 Quantitative Variables",
    "text": "4.4 Quantitative Variables\nVariables recorded in numbers that we use as numbers are called quantitative. Familiar examples include incomes, heights, weights, ages, distances, times, and counts. All quantitative variables have measurement units, which tell you how the quantitative variable was measured. Without units (like miles per hour, angstroms, yen or degrees Celsius) the values of a quantitative variable have no meaning.\n\nIt does little good to be told the price of something if you don’t know the currency being used.\nYou might be surprised to see someone whose age is 72 listed in a database on childhood diseases until you find out that age is measured in months.\nOften just seeking the units can reveal a variable whose definition is challenging - just how do we measure “friendliness”, or “success,” for example.\nQuantitative variables may also be classified by whether they are continuous or can only take on a discrete set of values. Continuous data may take on any value, within a defined range. Suppose we are measuring height. While height is really continuous, our measuring stick usually only lets us measure with a certain degree of precision. If our measurements are only trustworthy to the nearest centimeter with the ruler we have, we might describe them as discrete measures. But we could always get a more precise ruler. The measurement divisions we make in moving from a continuous concept to a discrete measurement are usually fairly arbitrary. Another way to think of this, if you enjoy music, is that, as suggested in Norman and Streiner (2014), a piano is a discrete instrument, but a violin is a continuous one, enabling finer distinctions between notes than the piano is capable of making. Sometimes the distinction between continuous and discrete is important, but usually, it’s not.\n\nThe nh_adult750 data includes several quantitative variables, specifically Age, Height, BMI,SBP,DBPandPulse`.\nWe know these are quantitative because they have units: Age in years, Height in centimeters, BMI in kg/m2, the BP measurements in mm Hg, and Pulse in beats per minute.\nDepending on the context, we would likely treat most of these as discrete given that are measurements are fairly crude (this is certainly true for Age, measured in years) although BMI is probably continuous in most settings, even though it is a function of two other measures (Height and Weight) which are rounded off to integer numbers of centimeters and kilograms, respectively.\n\nIt is also possible to separate out quantitative variables into ratio variables or interval variables. An interval variable has equal distances between values, but the zero point is arbitrary. A ratio variable has equal intervals between values, and a meaningful zero point. For example, weight is an example of a ratio variable, while IQ is an example of an interval variable. We all know what zero weight is. An intelligence score like IQ is a different matter. We say that the average IQ is 100, but that’s only by convention. We could just as easily have decided to add 400 to every IQ value and make the average 500 instead. Because IQ’s intervals are equal, the difference between and IQ of 70 and an IQ of 80 is the same as the difference between 120 and 130. However, an IQ of 100 is not twice as high as an IQ of 50. The point is that if the zero point is artificial and movable, then the differences between numbers are meaningful but the ratios between them are not. On the other hand, most lab test values are ratio variables, as are physical characteristics like height and weight. A person who weighs 100 kg is twice as heavy as one who weighs 50 kg; even when we convert kg to pounds, this is still true. For the most part, we can treat and analyze interval or ratio variables the same way.\n\nEach of the quantitative variables in our nh_adult750 data can be thought of as ratio variables.\n\nQuantitative variables lend themselves to many of the summaries we will discuss, like means, quantiles, and our various measures of spread, like the standard deviation or inter-quartile range. They also have at least a chance to follow the Normal distribution.\n\n\n4.4.1 A look at BMI (Body-Mass Index)\nThe definition of BMI (body-mass index) for adult subjects (which is expressed in units of kg/m2) is:\n\\[\n\\mbox{Body Mass Index} = \\frac{\\mbox{weight in kg}}{(\\mbox{height in meters})^2} = 703 \\times \\frac{\\mbox{weight in pounds}}{(\\mbox{height in inches})^2}\n\\]\n\n[BMI is essentially] … a measure of a person’s thinness or thickness… BMI was designed for use as a simple means of classifying average sedentary (physically inactive) populations, with an average body composition. For these individuals, the current value recommendations are as follow: a BMI from 18.5 up to 25 may indicate optimal weight, a BMI lower than 18.5 suggests the person is underweight, a number from 25 up to 30 may indicate the person is overweight, and a number from 30 upwards suggests the person is obese.\nWikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"

    "text": "4.5 Qualitative (Categorical) Variables\nQualitative or categorical variables consist of names of categories. These names may be numerical, but the numbers (or names) are simply codes to identify the groups or categories into which the individuals are divided. Categorical variables with two categories, like yes or no, up or down, or, more generally, 1 and 0, are called binary variables. Those with more than two-categories are sometimes called multi-categorical variables.\n\nWhen the categories included in a variable are merely names, and come in no particular order, we sometimes call them nominal variables. The most important summary of such a variable is usually a table of frequencies, and the mode becomes an important single summary, while the mean and median are essentially useless.\n\nIn the nh_adult750 data, Race is a nominal variable with multiple unordered categories. So is MaritalStatus.\n\nThe alternative categorical variable (where order matters) is called ordinal, and includes variables that are sometimes thought of as falling right in between quantitative and qualitative variables.\n\nExamples of ordinal multi-categorical variables in the nh_adult750 data include the Education and HealthGen variables.\nAnswers to questions like “How is your overall physical health?” with available responses Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair or Poor, which are often coded as 1-5, certainly provide a perceived order, but a group of people with average health status 4 (Very Good) is not necessarily twice as healthy as a group with average health status of 2 (Fair).\n\nSometimes we treat the values from ordinal variables as sufficiently scaled to permit us to use quantitative approaches like means, quantiles, and standard deviations to summarize and model the results, and at other times, we’ll treat ordinal variables as if they were nominal, with tables and percentages our primary tools.\nNote that all binary variables may be treated as ordinal, or nominal.\n\nBinary variables in the nh_adult750 data include Sex, PhysActive, Smoke100, SleepTrouble. Each can be thought of as either ordinal or nominal.\n\n\nLots of variables may be treated as either quantitative or qualitative, depending on how we use them. For instance, we usually think of age as a quantitative variable, but if we simply use age to make the distinction between “child” and “adult” then we are using it to describe categorical information. Just because your variable’s values are numbers, don’t assume that the information provided is quantitative."

    "text": "4.6 Counting Missing Values\nThe summary() command counts the number of missing observations in each variable, but sometimes you want considerably more information.\nWe can use some functions from the naniar package to learn useful things about the missing data in our nh_adult750 sample.\nThe miss_var_table command provides a table of the number of variables with 0, 1, 2, up to n, missing values and the percentage of the total number of variables those variables make up.\n\nmiss_var_table(nh_adult750)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  n_miss_in_var n_vars pct_vars\n          <int>  <int>    <dbl>\n1             0      9    56.2 \n2             5      3    18.8 \n3            32      1     6.25\n4            33      2    12.5 \n5            99      1     6.25\n\n\nSo, for instance, we have 9 variables with no missing data, and that constitutes 56.25% of the 16 variables in our nh_adult750 data.\nThe miss_var_summary() function tabulates the number, percent missing, and cumulative sum of missing of each variable in our data frame, in order of most to least missing values.\n\nmiss_var_summary(nh_adult750)\n\n# A tibble: 16 × 3\n   variable      n_miss pct_miss\n   <chr>          <int>    <dbl>\n 1 HealthGen         99   13.2  \n 2 SBP               33    4.4  \n 3 DBP               33    4.4  \n 4 Pulse             32    4.27 \n 5 Height             5    0.667\n 6 Weight             5    0.667\n 7 BMI                5    0.667\n 8 ID                 0    0    \n 9 Sex                0    0    \n10 Age                0    0    \n11 Race               0    0    \n12 Education          0    0    \n13 PhysActive         0    0    \n14 Smoke100           0    0    \n15 SleepTrouble       0    0    \n16 MaritalStatus      0    0    \n\n\nSo, for example, the rmiss_var_summary(nh_temp) |> slice_head(n = 1) |> select(variable)variable is the one missing more of our data than anything else within thenh_adult750` data frame.\nA graph of this information is available, as well.\n\ngg_miss_var(nh_adult750)\n\n\n\n\nI’ll note that there are also functions to count the number of missing observations by case (observation) rather than variable. For example, we can use miss_case_table.\n\nmiss_case_table(nh_adult750)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  n_miss_in_case n_cases pct_cases\n           <int>   <int>     <dbl>\n1              0     636    84.8  \n2              1      78    10.4  \n3              3      15     2    \n4              4      19     2.53 \n5              6       1     0.133\n6              7       1     0.133\n\n\nNow we see that 636 observations, or 84.8% of all cases have no missing data.\nWe can use miss_case_summary() to identify cases with missing data, as well.\n\nmiss_case_summary(nh_adult750)\n\n# A tibble: 750 × 3\n    case n_miss pct_miss\n   <int>  <int>    <dbl>\n 1   342      7     43.8\n 2   606      6     37.5\n 3   157      4     25  \n 4   169      4     25  \n 5   204      4     25  \n 6   234      4     25  \n 7   323      4     25  \n 8   415      4     25  \n 9   478      4     25  \n10   483      4     25  \n# … with 740 more rows\n# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows"

We might also collect the sum of the observations, and the count of the number of observations, usually symbolized with n.\nFor variables without missing values, like Age, this is pretty straightforward.\n\nnh_750 |>\n    summarise(n = n(), Mean = mean(Age), Median = median(Age), Sum = sum(Age))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n      n  Mean Median   Sum\n  <int> <dbl>  <dbl> <int>\n1   750  40.8     40 30616\n\n\nAnd again, the Mean is just the Sum (30616), divided by the number of non-missing values of Age (750), or 40.8213333.\nThe Median is the middle value when the data are sorted in order. When we have an odd number of values, this is sufficient. When we have an even number, as in this case, we take the mean of the two middle values. We could sort and list all 500 Ages, if we wanted to do so.\n\nnh_750 |> select(Age) |> \n    arrange(Age)\n\n# A tibble: 750 × 1\n     Age\n   <int>\n 1    21\n 2    21\n 3    21\n 4    21\n 5    21\n 6    21\n 7    21\n 8    21\n 9    21\n10    21\n# … with 740 more rows\n# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows\n\n\nBut this data set figures we don’t want to output more than 10 observations to a table like this.\nIf we really want to see all of the data, we can use View(nh_750) to get a spreadsheet-style presentation, or use the sort command…\n\nsort(nh_750$Age)\n\n  [1] 21 21 21 21 21 21 21 21 21 21 21 21 21 21 21 21 21 21 21 21 21 21 22 22 22\n [26] 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 23 23 23 23 23 23\n [51] 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24\n [76] 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25\n[101] 25 25 25 26 26 26 26 26 26 26 26 26 26 26 26 26 26 27 27 27 27 27 27 27 27\n[126] 27 27 27 27 27 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28 28\n[151] 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 30 30 30 30 30\n[176] 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 31 31 31 31 31 31\n[201] 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32\n[226] 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33\n[251] 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 34 34 34 34 34 34 34 34 34 34\n[276] 34 34 34 34 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 36 36 36 36 36 36 36 36 36 36\n[301] 36 36 36 36 36 36 36 36 36 36 36 36 36 36 36 36 37 37 37 37 37 37 37 37 37\n[326] 37 37 37 37 37 37 37 37 37 38 38 38 38 38 38 38 38 38 38 38 38 38 38 38 38\n[351] 39 39 39 39 39 39 39 39 39 39 39 39 39 39 39 39 39 39 39 40 40 40 40 40 40\n[376] 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41\n[401] 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 43 43 43 43 43 43\n[426] 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 44 44 44 44 44 44 44 44 44 44 44 44 44\n[451] 44 44 44 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 46 46 46 46 46\n[476] 46 46 46 46 46 46 46 46 46 47 47 47 47 47 47 47 47 47 47 47 47 47 47 47 47\n[501] 47 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49\n[526] 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50\n[551] 50 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 52 52 52 52\n[576] 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 53 53 53 53 53 53 53 53 53 53 53 53 53 53 53 54 54\n[601] 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 56\n[626] 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 57 57 57 57 57 57 57\n[651] 57 57 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 59 59 59 59 59\n[676] 59 59 59 59 59 59 59 59 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 61 61 61 61\n[701] 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 62 62 62 62 62 62 62 62 62 62 62 62 62 63 63\n[726] 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64\n\n\nAgain, to find the median, we would take the mean of the middle two observations in this sorted data set.

We can address this by either omitting the data with missing values before we run the summarise() function, or tell the mean and median summary functions to remove missing values2.\n\nnh_750 |>\n    filter(complete.cases(Pulse)) |>\n    summarise(count = n(), mean(Pulse), median(Pulse))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  count `mean(Pulse)` `median(Pulse)`\n  <int>         <dbl>           <dbl>\n1   718          73.5              72\n\n\nOr, we could tell the summary functions themselves to remove NA values.\n\nnh_750 |>\n    summarise(mean(Pulse, na.rm=TRUE), median(Pulse, na.rm=TRUE))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  `mean(Pulse, na.rm = TRUE)` `median(Pulse, na.rm = TRUE)`\n                        <dbl>                         <dbl>\n1                        73.5                            72\n\n\nIn Chapter @ref(miss), we will discuss various assumptions we can make about missing data, and the importance of imputation when dealing with it in modeling or making inferences. For now, we will limit our descriptive summaries to observed values, in what are called complete case or available case analyses.\n\n\n6.4.3 The Mode of a Quantitative Variable\nOne other less common measure of the center of a quantitative variable’s distribution is its most frequently observed value, referred to as the mode. This measure is only appropriate for discrete variables, be they quantitative or categorical. To find the mode, we usually tabulate the data, and then sort by the counts of the numbers of observations.\n\nnh_750 |>\n    group_by(Age) |>\n    summarise(count = n()) |>\n    arrange(desc(count)) \n\n# A tibble: 44 × 2\n     Age count\n   <int> <int>\n 1    32    28\n 2    36    26\n 3    50    26\n 4    30    24\n 5    33    24\n 6    24    23\n 7    21    22\n 8    22    22\n 9    23    22\n10    28    20\n# … with 34 more rows\n# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows\n\n\nThe mode is just the most common Age observed in the data.\nNote the use of three different “verbs” in our function there - for more explanation of this strategy, visit Wickham and Grolemund (2022). The group_by function here is very useful. It converts the nh_750 data frame into a new grouped tibble where operations are performed on the groups. Here, this means that it groups the data by Age before counting observations, and then sorting the groups (the Ages) by their frequencies.\nAs an alternative, the modeest package’s mfv function calculates the sample mode (or most frequent value) 3."

    "text": "6.5 Measuring the Spread of a Distribution\nStatistics is all about variation, so spread or dispersion is an important fundamental concept in statistics. Measures of spread like the inter-quartile range and range (maximum - minimum) can help us understand and compare data sets. If the values in the data are close to the center, the spread will be small. If many of the values in the data are scattered far away from the center, the spread will be large.\n\n6.5.1 The Range and the Interquartile Range (IQR)\nThe range of a quantitative variable is sometimes interpreted as the difference between the maximum and the minimum, even though R presents the actual minimum and maximum values when you ask for a range…\n\nnh_750 |> \n    select(Age) |> \n    range()\n\n[1] 21 64\n\n\nAnd, for a variable with missing values, we can use…\n\nnh_750 |> \n    select(BMI) |> \n    filter(complete.cases(BMI)) |>\n    range()\n\n[1] 16.7 80.6\n\n\nA more interesting and useful statistic is the inter-quartile range, or IQR, which is the range of the middle half of the distribution, calculated by subtracting the 25th percentile value from the 75th percentile value.\n\nnh_750 |>\n    summarise(IQR(Age), quantile(Age, 0.25), quantile(Age, 0.75))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  `IQR(Age)` `quantile(Age, 0.25)` `quantile(Age, 0.75)`\n       <dbl>                 <dbl>                 <dbl>\n1         21                    30                    51\n\n\nWe can calculate the range and IQR nicely from the summary information on quantiles, of course:\n\nnh_750 |>\n    select(Age, BMI, SBP, DBP, Pulse) |>\n    summary()\n\n      Age             BMI             SBP             DBP        \n Min.   :21.00   Min.   :16.70   Min.   : 83.0   Min.   :  0.00  \n 1st Qu.:30.00   1st Qu.:24.20   1st Qu.:108.0   1st Qu.: 66.00  \n Median :40.00   Median :27.90   Median :118.0   Median : 73.00  \n Mean   :40.82   Mean   :29.08   Mean   :118.8   Mean   : 72.69  \n 3rd Qu.:51.00   3rd Qu.:32.10   3rd Qu.:127.0   3rd Qu.: 80.00  \n Max.   :64.00   Max.   :80.60   Max.   :209.0   Max.   :108.00  \n                 NA's   :5       NA's   :33      NA's   :33      \n     Pulse       \n Min.   : 40.00  \n 1st Qu.: 66.00  \n Median : 72.00  \n Mean   : 73.53  \n 3rd Qu.: 80.00  \n Max.   :124.00  \n NA's   :32      \n\n\n\n\n6.5.2 The Variance and the Standard Deviation\nThe IQR is always a reasonable summary of spread, just as the median is always a reasonable summary of the center of a distribution. Yet, most people are inclined to summarize a batch of data using two numbers: the mean and the standard deviation. This is really only a sensible thing to do if you are willing to assume the data follow a Normal distribution: a bell-shaped, symmetric distribution without substantial outliers.\nBut most data do not (even approximately) follow a Normal distribution. Summarizing by the median and quartiles (25th and 75th percentiles) is much more robust, explaining R’s emphasis on them.\n\n\n6.5.3 Obtaining the Variance and Standard Deviation in R\nHere are the variances of the quantitative variables in the nh_750 data. Note the need to include na.rm = TRUE to deal with the missing values in some variables.\n\nnh_750 |>\n    select(Age, BMI, SBP, DBP, Pulse) |>\n    summarise_all(var, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 5\n    Age   BMI   SBP   DBP Pulse\n  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n1  157.  52.4  229.  128.  136.\n\n\nAnd here are the standard deviations of those same variables.\n\nnh_750 |>\n    select(Age, BMI, SBP, DBP, Pulse) |>\n    summarise_all(sd, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 5\n    Age   BMI   SBP   DBP Pulse\n  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n1  12.5  7.24  15.1  11.3  11.6\n\n\n\n\n6.5.4 Defining the Variance and Standard Deviation\nBock, Velleman, and De Veaux (2004) have lots of useful thoughts here, which are lightly edited here.\nIn thinking about spread, we might consider how far each data value is from the mean. Such a difference is called a deviation. We could just average the deviations, but the positive and negative differences always cancel out, leaving an average deviation of zero, so that’s not helpful. Instead, we square each deviation to obtain non-negative values, and to emphasize larger differences. When we add up these squared deviations and find their mean (almost), this yields the variance.\n\\[\n\\mbox{Variance} = s^2 = \\frac{\\Sigma (y - \\bar{y})^2}{n-1}\n\\]\nWhy almost? It would be the mean of the squared deviations only if we divided the sum by \\(n\\), but instead we divide by \\(n-1\\) because doing so produces an estimate of the true (population) variance that is unbiased4. If you’re looking for a more intuitive explanation, this Stack Exchange link awaits your attention.\n\nTo return to the original units of measurement, we take the square root of \\(s^2\\), and instead work with \\(s\\), the standard deviation, also abbreviated SD.\n\n\\[\n\\mbox{Standard Deviation} = s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Sigma (y - \\bar{y})^2}{n-1}}\n\\]\n\n\n6.5.5 Interpreting the SD when the data are Normally distributed\nFor a set of measurements that follow a Normal distribution, the interval:\n\nMean \\(\\pm\\) Standard Deviation contains approximately 68% of the measurements;\nMean \\(\\pm\\) 2(Standard Deviation) contains approximately 95% of the measurements;\nMean \\(\\pm\\) 3(Standard Deviation) contains approximately all (99.7%) of the measurements.\n\nWe often refer to the population or process mean of a distribution with \\(\\mu\\) and the standard deviation with \\(\\sigma\\), leading to the Figure below.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Normal Distribution and the Empirical Rule\n\n\n\n\nBut if the data are not from an approximately Normal distribution, then this Empirical Rule is less helpful.\n\n\n6.5.6 Chebyshev’s Inequality: One Interpretation of the Standard Deviation\nChebyshev’s Inequality tells us that for any distribution, regardless of its relationship to a Normal distribution, no more than 1/k2 of the distribution’s values can lie more than k standard deviations from the mean. This implies, for instance, that for any distribution, at least 75% of the values must lie within two standard deviations of the mean, and at least 89% must lie within three standard deviations of the mean.\nAgain, most data sets do not follow a Normal distribution. We’ll return to this notion soon. But first, let’s try to draw some pictures that let us get a better understanding of the distribution of our data."

    "section": "6.6 Measuring the Shape of a Distribution",
    "text": "6.6 Measuring the Shape of a Distribution\nWhen considering the shape of a distribution, one is often interested in three key points.\n\nThe number of modes in the distribution, which I always assess through plotting the data.\nThe skewness, or symmetry that is present, which I typically assess by looking at a plot of the distribution of the data, but if required to, will summarize with a non-parametric measure of skewness.\nThe kurtosis, or heavy-tailedness (outlier-proneness) that is present, usually in comparison to a Normal distribution. Again, this is something I nearly inevitably assess graphically, but there are measures.\n\nA Normal distribution has a single mode, is symmetric and, naturally, is neither heavy-tailed nor light-tailed as compared to a Normal distribution (we call this mesokurtic).\n\n6.6.1 Multimodal vs. Unimodal distributions\nA unimodal distribution, on some level, is straightforward. It is a distribution with a single mode, or “peak” in the distribution. Such a distribution may be skewed or symmetric, light-tailed or heavy-tailed. We usually describe as multimodal distributions like the two on the right below, which have multiple local maxima, even though they have just a single global maximum peak.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnimodal and Multimodal Sketches\n\n\n\n\nTruly multimodal distributions are usually described that way in terms of shape. For unimodal distributions, skewness and kurtosis become useful ideas.\n\n\n6.6.2 Skew\nWhether or not a distribution is approximately symmetric is an important consideration in describing its shape. Graphical assessments are always most useful in this setting, particularly for unimodal data. My favorite measure of skew, or skewness if the data have a single mode, is:\n\\[\nskew_1 = \\frac{\\mbox{mean} - \\mbox{median}}{\\mbox{standard deviation}}\n\\]\n\nSymmetric distributions generally show values of \\(skew_1\\) near zero. If the distribution is actually symmetric, the mean should be equal to the median.\nDistributions with \\(skew_1\\) values above 0.2 in absolute value generally indicate meaningful skew.\nPositive skew (mean > median if the data are unimodal) is also referred to as right skew.\nNegative skew (mean < median if the data are unimodal) is referred to as left skew.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNegative (Left) Skew and Positive (Right) Skew\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.6.3 Kurtosis\nWhen we have a unimodal distribution that is symmetric, we will often be interested in the behavior of the tails of the distribution, as compared to a Normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation. High values of kurtosis measures (and there are several) indicate data which has extreme outliers, or is heavy-tailed.\n\nA mesokurtic distribution has similar tail behavior to what we would expect from a Normal distribution.\nA leptokurtic distribution is a thinner, more slender distribution, with heavier tails than we’d expect from a Normal distribution. One example is the t distribution.\nA platykurtic distribution is a broader, flatter distribution, with thinner tails than we’d expect from a Normal distribution. One example is a uniform distribution.\n\n\nset.seed(431)\nsims_kurt <- tibble(meso = rnorm(n = 300, mean = 0, sd = 1),\n                    lepto = rt(n = 300, df = 4),\n                    platy = runif(n = 300, min = -2, max = 2))\n\np1 <- ggplot(sims_kurt, aes(x = meso)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = stat(density)), \n                 bins = 25, fill = \"royalblue\", col = \"white\") +\n  stat_function(fun = dnorm, \n                args = list(mean = mean(sims_kurt$meso), \n                            sd = sd(sims_kurt$meso)),\n                col = \"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Normal (mesokurtic)\")\n\np1a <- ggplot(sims_kurt, aes(x = meso, y = \"\")) +\n  geom_violin() +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"royalblue\", outlier.color = \"royalblue\", width = 0.3) +\n  labs(y = \"\", x = \"Normal (mesokurtic)\")\n\np2 <- ggplot(sims_kurt, aes(x = lepto)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = stat(density)), \n                 bins = 25, fill = \"tomato\", col = \"white\") +\n  stat_function(fun = dnorm, \n                args = list(mean = mean(sims_kurt$lepto), \n                            sd = sd(sims_kurt$lepto)),\n                col = \"royalblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"t (leptokurtic)\")\n\np2a <- ggplot(sims_kurt, aes(x = lepto, y = \"\")) +\n  geom_violin() +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"tomato\", outlier.color = \"tomato\", width = 0.3) +\n  labs(y = \"\", x = \"t (slender with heavy tails)\")\n\np3 <- ggplot(sims_kurt, aes(x = platy)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = stat(density)), \n                 bins = 25, fill = \"yellow\", col = \"black\") +\n  stat_function(fun = dnorm, \n                args = list(mean = mean(sims_kurt$platy), \n                            sd = sd(sims_kurt$platy)),\n                col = \"royalblue\", lwd = 1.5) +\n  xlim(-3, 3) +\n  labs(title = \"Uniform (platykurtic)\")\n\np3a <- ggplot(sims_kurt, aes(x = platy, y = \"\")) +\n  geom_violin() +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"yellow\", width = 0.3) + \n  xlim(-3, 3) +\n  labs(y = \"\", x = \"Uniform (broad with thin tails)\")\n\n\n(p1 + p2 + p3) / (p1a + p2a + p3a) + \n  plot_layout(heights = c(3, 1))\n\n\n\n\nGraphical tools are in most cases the best way to identify issues related to kurtosis."

These are:\n\ndistinct - the number of different values observed in the data.\nInfo - a measure of how “continuous” the variable is, related to how many “ties” there are in the data, with Info taking a higher value (closer to its maximum of one) if the data are more continuous.\nGmd - the Gini mean difference - a robust measure of spread that is calculated as the mean absolute difference between any pairs of observations. Larger values of Gmd indicate more spread-out distributions. (Gini is pronounced as either “Genie” or “Ginny”.)\n\n\n\n6.7.4 Other options\nThe package summarytools has a function called dfSummary which I like and Dominic Comtois has also published Recommendations for Using summarytools with R Markdown. Note that this isn’t really for Word documents.\nDataExplorer can be used for more automated exploratory data analyses (and some people also like skimr) and visdat, as well.\nThe df_stats function available when the mosaic package is loaded allows you to run favstats for multiple outcome variables simultaneously.\n\n\n\n\nBock, David E., Paul F.

    "section": "7.8 Cross-Tabulations of Two Variables",
    "text": "7.8 Cross-Tabulations of Two Variables\nIt is very common for us to want to describe the association of one categorical variable with another. For instance, is there a relationship between Education and SleepTrouble in these data?\n\nnh_750 |>\n    tabyl(Education, SleepTrouble) |>\n    adorn_totals(where = c(\"row\", \"col\")) \n\n      Education  No Yes Total\n      8th Grade  40  10    50\n 9 - 11th Grade  52  24    76\n    High School 102  41   143\n   Some College 173  68   241\n   College Grad 188  52   240\n          Total 555 195   750\n\n\nNote the use of adorn_totals to get the marginal counts, and how we specify that we want both the row and column totals. We can add a title for the columns with…\n\nnh_750 |>\n    tabyl(Education, SleepTrouble) |>\n    adorn_totals(where = c(\"row\", \"col\")) |>\n    adorn_title(placement = \"combined\")\n\n Education/SleepTrouble  No Yes Total\n              8th Grade  40  10    50\n         9 - 11th Grade  52  24    76\n            High School 102  41   143\n           Some College 173  68   241\n           College Grad 188  52   240\n                  Total 555 195   750\n\n\nOften, we’ll want to show percentages in a cross-tabulation like this. To get row percentages so that we can directly see the probability of SleepTrouble = Yes for each level of Education, we can use:\n\nnh_750 |>\n    tabyl(Education, SleepTrouble) |>\n    adorn_totals(where = \"row\") |>\n    adorn_percentages(denominator = \"row\") |>\n    adorn_pct_formatting() |>\n    adorn_title(placement = \"combined\")\n\n Education/SleepTrouble    No   Yes\n              8th Grade 80.0% 20.0%\n         9 - 11th Grade 68.4% 31.6%\n            High School 71.3% 28.7%\n           Some College 71.8% 28.2%\n           College Grad 78.3% 21.7%\n                  Total 74.0% 26.0%\n\n\nIf we want to compare the distribution of Education between the two levels of SleepTrouble with column percentages, we can use the following…\n\nnh_750 |>\n    tabyl(Education, SleepTrouble) |>\n    adorn_totals(where = \"col\") |>\n    adorn_percentages(denominator = \"col\") |>\n    adorn_pct_formatting() |>\n    adorn_title(placement = \"combined\") \n\n Education/SleepTrouble    No   Yes Total\n              8th Grade  7.2%  5.1%  6.7%\n         9 - 11th Grade  9.4% 12.3% 10.1%\n            High School 18.4% 21.0% 19.1%\n           Some College 31.2% 34.9% 32.1%\n           College Grad 33.9% 26.7% 32.0%\n\n\nIf we want overall percentages in the cells of the table, so that the total across all combinations of Education and SleepTrouble is 100%, we can use:\n\nnh_750 |>\n    tabyl(Education, SleepTrouble) |>\n    adorn_totals(where = c(\"row\", \"col\")) |>\n    adorn_percentages(denominator = \"all\") |>\n    adorn_pct_formatting() |>\n    adorn_title(placement = \"combined\") \n\n Education/SleepTrouble    No   Yes  Total\n              8th Grade  5.3%  1.3%   6.7%\n         9 - 11th Grade  6.9%  3.2%  10.1%\n            High School 13.6%  5.5%  19.1%\n           Some College 23.1%  9.1%  32.1%\n           College Grad 25.1%  6.9%  32.0%\n                  Total 74.0% 26.0% 100.0%\n\n\nAnother common approach is to include both counts and percentages in a cross-tabulation. Let’s look at the breakdown of HealthGen by MaritalStatus.\n\nnh_750 |>\n    tabyl(MaritalStatus, HealthGen) |>\n    adorn_totals(where = c(\"row\")) |>\n    adorn_percentages(denominator = \"row\") |>\n    adorn_pct_formatting() |>\n    adorn_ns(position = \"front\") |>\n    adorn_title(placement = \"combined\") |>\n    knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaritalStatus/HealthGen\nExcellent\nVgood\nGood\nFair\nPoor\nNA_\n\n\n\n\nDivorced\n7 (9.0%)\n19 (24.4%)\n29 (37.2%)\n11 (14.1%)\n3 (3.8%)\n9 (11.5%)\n\n\nLivePartner\n4 (5.7%)\n19 (27.1%)\n25 (35.7%)\n18 (25.7%)\n0 (0.0%)\n4 (5.7%)\n\n\nMarried\n46 (11.9%)\n101 (26.0%)\n130 (33.5%)\n41 (10.6%)\n6 (1.5%)\n64 (16.5%)\n\n\nNeverMarried\n25 (14.0%)\n52 (29.1%)\n56 (31.3%)\n24 (13.4%)\n3 (1.7%)\n19 (10.6%)\n\n\nSeparated\n2 (10.5%)\n3 (15.8%)\n4 (21.1%)\n8 (42.1%)\n0 (0.0%)\n2 (10.5%)\n\n\nWidowed\n0 (0.0%)\n3 (18.8%)\n8 (50.0%)\n2 (12.5%)\n2 (12.5%)\n1 (6.2%)\n\n\nTotal\n84 (11.2%)\n197 (26.3%)\n252 (33.6%)\n104 (13.9%)\n14 (1.9%)\n99 (13.2%)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if we wanted to ignore the missing HealthGen values? Most often, I filter down to the complete observations.\n\nnh_750 |>\n    filter(complete.cases(MaritalStatus, HealthGen)) |>\n    tabyl(MaritalStatus, HealthGen) |>\n    adorn_totals(where = c(\"row\")) |>\n    adorn_percentages(denominator = \"row\") |>\n    adorn_pct_formatting() |>\n    adorn_ns(position = \"front\") |>\n    adorn_title(placement = \"combined\")\n\n MaritalStatus/HealthGen  Excellent       Vgood        Good        Fair\n                Divorced  7 (10.1%)  19 (27.5%)  29 (42.0%)  11 (15.9%)\n             LivePartner  4  (6.1%)  19 (28.8%)  25 (37.9%)  18 (27.3%)\n                 Married 46 (14.2%) 101 (31.2%) 130 (40.1%)  41 (12.7%)\n            NeverMarried 25 (15.6%)  52 (32.5%)  56 (35.0%)  24 (15.0%)\n               Separated  2 (11.8%)   3 (17.6%)   4 (23.5%)   8 (47.1%)\n                 Widowed  0  (0.0%)   3 (20.0%)   8 (53.3%)   2 (13.3%)\n                   Total 84 (12.9%) 197 (30.3%) 252 (38.7%) 104 (16.0%)\n       Poor\n  3  (4.3%)\n  0  (0.0%)\n  6  (1.9%)\n  3  (1.9%)\n  0  (0.0%)\n  2 (13.3%)\n 14  (2.2%)\n\n\nFor more on working with tabyls, see the vignette in the janitor package. There you’ll find a complete list of all of the adorn functions, for example.\nHere’s another approach, to look at the cross-classification of Race and HealthGen:\n\nxtabs(~ Race + HealthGen, data = nh_750)\n\n          HealthGen\nRace       Excellent Vgood Good Fair Poor\n  Asian           10    17   24    6    1\n  Black           15    28   40   24    4\n  Hispanic         4     9   24   13    2\n  Mexican          6    12   25   21    2\n  White           48   128  131   37    5\n  Other            1     3    8    3    0"

These alternatives include the use of the xtabs function:\n\nxtabs(~ Smoke100 + PhysActive + SleepTrouble, data = nh_750)\n\n, , SleepTrouble = No\n\n        PhysActive\nSmoke100  No Yes\n     No  137 219\n     Yes  93 106\n\n, , SleepTrouble = Yes\n\n        PhysActive\nSmoke100  No Yes\n     No   41  56\n     Yes  55  43\n\n\nWe can also build a flat version of this table, as follows:\n\nftable(Smoke100 ~ PhysActive + SleepTrouble, data = nh_750)\n\n                        Smoke100  No Yes\nPhysActive SleepTrouble                 \nNo         No                    137  93\n           Yes                    41  55\nYes        No                    219 106\n           Yes                    56  43\n\n\nAnd we can do this with dplyr functions and the table() function, as well, for example…\n\nnh_750 |>\n    select(Smoke100, PhysActive, SleepTrouble) |>\n    table() \n\n, , SleepTrouble = No\n\n        PhysActive\nSmoke100  No Yes\n     No  137 219\n     Yes  93 106\n\n, , SleepTrouble = Yes\n\n        PhysActive\nSmoke100  No Yes\n     No   41  56\n     Yes  55  43"

The gt package allows you to start with a tibble or data frame, and use it to make very detailed tables that look professional, and includes tools that enable you to include titles and subtitles, all sorts of labels, as well as footnotes and source notes.\nHere’s a fairly simple example of a cross-tabulation of part of the nh_750 data built using a few tools from the gt package.\n\ntemp_tbl <- nh_750 |> filter(complete.cases(PhysActive, HealthGen)) |>\n  tabyl(PhysActive, HealthGen) |>\n  tibble() \n\ngt(temp_tbl) |>\n  tab_header(title = md(\"**Cross-Tabulation from nh_750**\"),\n             subtitle = md(\"Physical Activity vs. Overall Health\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Cross-Tabulation from nh_750\n    \n    \n      Physical Activity vs. Overall Health\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      PhysActive\n      Excellent\n      Vgood\n      Good\n      Fair\n      Poor\n    \n  \n  \n    No\n24\n66\n126\n59\n10\n    Yes\n60\n131\n126\n45\n4\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nThe gt package and its usage is described in detail at https://gt.rstudio.com/.\n\n\n\n\nWainer, Howard. 1997.

    "text": "8.4 Missing-data mechanisms\nMy source for this description of mechanisms is Chapter 25 of Gelman and Hill (2007), and that chapter is available at this link.\n\nMCAR = Missingness completely at random. A variable is missing completely at random if the probability of missingness is the same for all units, for example, if for each subject, we decide whether to collect the diabetes status by rolling a die and refusing to answer if a “6” shows up. If data are missing completely at random, then throwing out cases with missing data does not bias your inferences.\nMissingness that depends only on observed predictors. A more general assumption, called missing at random or MAR, is that the probability a variable is missing depends only on available information. Here, we would have to be willing to assume that the probability of nonresponse to diabetes depends only on the other, fully recorded variables in the data. It is often reasonable to model this process as a logistic regression, where the outcome variable equals 1 for observed cases and 0 for missing. When an outcome variable is missing at random, it is acceptable to exclude the missing cases (that is, to treat them as NA), as long as the regression controls for all the variables that affect the probability of missingness.\nMissingness that depends on unobserved predictors. Missingness is no longer “at random” if it depends on information that has not been recorded and this information also predicts the missing values. If a particular treatment causes discomfort, a patient is more likely to drop out of the study. This missingness is not at random (unless “discomfort” is measured and observed for all patients). If missingness is not at random, it must be explicitly modeled, or else you must accept some bias in your inferences.\nMissingness that depends on the missing value itself. Finally, a particularly difficult situation arises when the probability of missingness depends on the (potentially missing) variable itself. For example, suppose that people with higher earnings are less likely to reveal them.\n\nEssentially, situations 3 and 4 are referred to collectively as non-random missingness, and cause more trouble for us than 1 and 2."

However, such an approach, though easy to understand, underestimates variance and ignores the relationship of missing values to other variables.\nSingle imputation can also be done using a variety of models to try to capture information about the NA values that are available in other variables within the data set.\nThe simputation package can help us execute single imputations using a wide variety of techniques, within the pipe approach used by the tidyverse. Another approach I have used in the past is the mice package, which can also perform single imputations."

We’ll use the simputation package to accomplish it.\n\nThe simputation vignette is available at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/simputation/vignettes/intro.html\nThe simputation reference manual is available at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/simputation/simputation.pdf\n\nSuppose we wanted to use:\n\na robust linear model to predict sbp.before missing values, on the basis of sbp.after and diabetes status, and\na predictive mean matching approach (which, unlike the robust linear model, will ensure that only values of diabetes that we’ve seen before will be imputed) to predict diabetes status, on the basis of sbp.after, and\na decision tree approach to predict treat status, using all other variables in the data\n\n\nset.seed(50001)\n\nimp.2 <- sbp_example |>\n    impute_rlm(sbp.before ~ sbp.after + diabetes) |>\n    impute_pmm(diabetes ~ sbp.after) |>\n    impute_cart(treat ~ .)\n\nimp.2\n\n# A tibble: 15 × 5\n   subject treat diabetes sbp.before sbp.after\n *   <int> <fct>    <dbl>      <dbl>     <dbl>\n 1     101 A            1       120        105\n 2     102 B            0       145        135\n 3     103 C            0       150        150\n 4     104 A            1       139.       120\n 5     105 C            1       155        135\n 6     106 A            1       136.       115\n 7     107 A            0       135        160\n 8     108 A            1       155.       150\n 9     109 B            1       115        130\n10     110 C            1       170        155\n11     111 A            0       150        140\n12     112 B            0       145        140\n13     113 C            1       140        150\n14     114 A            1       160        135\n15     115 B            1       135        120\n\n\nDetails on the many available methods in simputation are provided in its manual. These include:\n\nimpute_cart uses a Classification and Regression Tree approach for numerical or categorical data. There is also an impute_rf command which uses Random Forests for imputation.\nimpute_pmm is one of several “hot deck” options for imputation, this one is predictive mean matching, which can be used with numeric data (only). Missing values are first imputed using a predictive model. Next, these predictions are replaced with the observed values which are nearest to the prediction. Other imputation options in this group include random hot deck, sequential hot deck and k-nearest neighbor imputation.\nimpute_rlm is one of several regression imputation methods, including linear models, robust linear models (which use what is called M-estimation to impute numerical variables) and lasso/elastic net/ridge regression models.\n\nThe simputation package can also do EM-based multivariate imputation, and multivariate random forest imputation, and several other approaches.\n\n\n\n\nGelman, Andrew, and Jennifer Hill. 2007.

    "text": "9.2 What is the NHANES NYFS?\nThe nnyfs.csv and the nnyfs.Rds data files were built by Professor Love using data from the 2012 National Youth Fitness Survey.\n\nThe NHANES National Youth Fitness Survey (NNYFS) was conducted in 2012 to collect data on physical activity and fitness levels in order to provide an evaluation of the health and fitness of children in the U.S. ages 3 to 15. The NNYFS collected data on physical activity and fitness levels of our youth through interviews and fitness tests.\n\nIn the nnyfs data file (either .csv or .Rds), I’m only providing a modest fraction of the available information. More on the NNYFS (including information I’m not using) is available at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/nnyfs12.aspx.\nThe data elements I’m using fall into four main groups, or components:\n\nDemographics\nDietary\nExamination and\nQuestionnaire\n\nWhat I did was merge a few elements from each of the available components of the NHANES National Youth Fitness Survey, reformulated (and in some cases simplified) some variables, and restricted the sample to kids who had completed elements of each of the four components."

Let’s run through the first few in a little detail.\n\n9.4.1 SEQN\nThe first variable, SEQN is just a (numerical) identifying code attributable to a given subject of the survey. This is nominal data, which will be of little interest down the line. On some occasions, as in this case, the ID numbers are sequential, in the sense that subject 71919 was included in the data base after subject 71918, but this fact isn’t particularly interesting here, because the protocol remained unchanged throughout the study.\n\n\n9.4.2 sex\nThe second variable, sex, is listed as a factor variable (R uses factor and character to refer to categorical, especially non-numeric information). Here, as we can see below, we have two levels, Female and Male.\n\nnnyfs |>\n  tabyl(sex) |>\n  adorn_totals() |>\n  adorn_pct_formatting()\n\n    sex    n percent\n Female  760   50.1%\n   Male  758   49.9%\n  Total 1518  100.0%\n\n\n\n\n9.4.3 age_child\nThe third variable, age_child, is the age of the child at the time of their screening to be in the study, measured in years. Note that age is a continuous concept, but the measure used here (number of full years alive) is a common discrete approach to measurement. Age, of course, has a meaningful zero point, so this can be thought of as a ratio variable; a child who is 6 is half as old as one who is 12. We can tabulate the observed values, since there are only a dozen or so.\n\nnnyfs |> tabyl(age_child) |>\n  adorn_pct_formatting()\n\n age_child   n percent\n         3 110    7.2%\n         4 112    7.4%\n         5 114    7.5%\n         6 129    8.5%\n         7 123    8.1%\n         8 112    7.4%\n         9  99    6.5%\n        10 124    8.2%\n        11 111    7.3%\n        12 137    9.0%\n        13 119    7.8%\n        14 130    8.6%\n        15  98    6.5%\n\n\nAt the time of initial screening, these children should have been between 3 and 15 years of age, so things look reasonable.

The BMI is a person’s weight in kilograms divided by his or her height in meters squared. Symbolically, BMI = weight in kg / (height in m)2. This is a continuous concept, measured to as many decimal places as you like, and it has a meaningful zero point, so it’s a ratio variable.\n\nnnyfs |> select(bmi) |> summary()\n\n      bmi       \n Min.   :11.90  \n 1st Qu.:15.90  \n Median :18.10  \n Mean   :19.63  \n 3rd Qu.:21.90  \n Max.   :48.30  \n NA's   :4      \n\n\nWhy would a table of these BMI values not be a great idea, for these data? A hint is that R represents this variable as num or numeric in its depiction of the data structure, and this implies that R has some decimal values stored. Here, I’ll use the head() function and the tail() function to show the first few and the last few values of what would prove to be a very long table of bmi values.\n\nnnyfs |> tabyl(bmi) |> \n  adorn_pct_formatting() |> \n  head()\n\n  bmi n percent valid_percent\n 11.9 1    0.1%          0.1%\n 12.6 1    0.1%          0.1%\n 12.7 1    0.1%          0.1%\n 12.9 1    0.1%          0.1%\n 13.0 2    0.1%          0.1%\n 13.1 1    0.1%          0.1%\n\n\n\nnnyfs |> tabyl(bmi) |> \n  adorn_pct_formatting() |> \n  tail()\n\n  bmi n percent valid_percent\n 42.8 1    0.1%          0.1%\n 43.0 1    0.1%          0.1%\n 46.9 1    0.1%          0.1%\n 48.2 1    0.1%          0.1%\n 48.3 1    0.1%          0.1%\n   NA 4    0.3%             -\n\n\n\n\n9.4.7 bmi_cat\nNext I’ll look at the bmi_cat information. This is a four-category ordinal variable, which divides the sample according to BMI into four groups. The BMI categories use sex-specific 2000 BMI-for-age (in months) growth charts prepared by the Centers for Disease Control for the US. We can get the breakdown from a table of the variable’s values.\n\nnnyfs |> tabyl(bmi_cat) |> adorn_pct_formatting()\n\n       bmi_cat   n percent valid_percent\n 1_Underweight  41    2.7%          2.7%\n      2_Normal 920   60.6%         60.8%\n  3_Overweight 258   17.0%         17.0%\n       4_Obese 295   19.4%         19.5%\n          <NA>   4    0.3%             -\n\n\nIn terms of percentiles by age and sex from the growth charts, the meanings of the categories are:\n\nUnderweight (BMI < 5th percentile)\nNormal weight (BMI 5th to < 85th percentile)\nOverweight (BMI 85th to < 95th percentile)\nObese (BMI \\(\\geq\\) 95th percentile)\n\nNote how I’ve used labels in the bmi_cat variable that include a number at the start so that the table results are sorted in a rational way. R sorts tables alphabetically, in general. We’ll use the forcats package to work with categorical variables that we store as factors eventually, but for now, we’ll keep things relatively simple.\nNote that the bmi_cat data don’t completely separate out the raw bmi data, because the calculation of percentiles requires different tables for each combination of age and sex.\n\nmosaic::favstats(bmi ~ bmi_cat, data = nnyfs) |>\n  kable(digits = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbmi_cat\nmin\nQ1\nmedian\nQ3\nmax\nmean\nsd\nn\nmissing\n\n\n\n\n1_Underweight\n11.9\n13.4\n13.7\n15.0\n16.5\n14.1\n1.1\n41\n0\n\n\n2_Normal\n13.5\n15.4\n16.5\n18.7\n24.0\n17.2\n2.3\n920\n0\n\n\n3_Overweight\n16.9\n18.3\n21.4\n23.4\n27.9\n21.2\n2.9\n258\n0\n\n\n4_Obese\n17.9\n22.3\n26.2\n30.2\n48.3\n26.7\n5.7\n295\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4.8 waist\nLet’s also look briefly at waist, which is the circumference of the child’s waist, in centimeters.

This is one of several common locations used for the assessment of body fat using skinfold calipers, and is a frequent part of growth assessments in children. Again, this is a numeric variable according to R.\n\nmosaic::favstats(~ triceps_skinfold, data = nnyfs)\n\n min  Q1 median Q3  max     mean       sd    n missing\n   4 9.1   12.4 18 38.8 14.35725 6.758825 1497      21\n\n\nAnd here’s a histogram of the triceps skinfold data, with the fill and color flipped from what we saw in the plot of the waist circumference data a moment ago.\n\nggplot(nnyfs, aes(x = triceps_skinfold)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 25, fill = \"cyan\", color = \"tomato\")\n\nWarning: Removed 21 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).\n\n\n\n\n\nOK.

In this case, we have \\(n\\) = 1518 observations. The Freedman-Diaconis rule can be helpful here. That rule suggests that we set the bin-width to\n\\[\nh = \\frac{2*IQR}{n^{1/3}}\n\\]\nso that the number of bins is equal to the range of the data set (maximum - minimum) divided by \\(h\\).\nFor the energy data in the nnyfs tibble, we have\n\nIQR of 938.5, \\(n\\) = 1518 and range = 5008\nThus, by the Freedman-Diaconis rule, the optimal binwidth \\(h\\) is 163.3203676, or, realistically, 163.\nAnd so the number of bins would be 30.6636586, or, realistically 31.\n\nHere, we’ll draw the graph again, using the Freedman-Diaconis rule to identify the number of bins, and also play around a bit with the fill and color of the bars.\n\nbw <- 2 * IQR(nnyfs$energy) / length(nnyfs$energy)^(1/3)\nggplot(data = nnyfs, aes(x = energy)) +\n    geom_histogram(binwidth=bw, color = \"white\", fill = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\nThis is a nice start, but it is by no means a finished graph.\nLet’s improve the axis labels, add a title, and fill in the bars with a distinctive blue and use a black outline around each bar.

My favorite list of R colors is http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf. In a pinch, you can usually find it by googling Colors in R. You can also type colors() in the R console to obtain a list of the names of the same 657 colors.\nWhen using colors to make comparisons, you may be interested in using a scale that has some nice properties. The viridis package vignette describes four color scales (viridis, magma, plasma and inferno) that are designed to be colorful, robust to colorblindness and gray scale printing, and perceptually uniform, which means (as the package authors describe it) that values close to each other have similar-appearing colors and values far away from each other have more different-appearing colors, consistently across the range of values. We can apply these colors with special functions within ggplot.\nHere’s a comparison of several histograms, looking at energy consumed as a function of whether yesterday was typical in terms of food consumption.\n\nggplot(data = nnyfs, aes(x = energy, fill = diet_yesterday)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 20, col = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d() +\n  facet_wrap(~ diet_yesterday)\n\n\n\n\nWe don’t really need the legend here, and perhaps we should restrict the plot to participants who responded to the diet_yesterday question, and put in a title and better axis labels?\n\nnnyfs |> filter(!is.na(energy), !is.na(diet_yesterday)) %>%\n  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = energy, fill = diet_yesterday)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 20, col = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d() +\n  guides(fill = \"none\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ diet_yesterday) +\n  labs(x = \"Energy consumed, in kcal\",\n       title = \"Energy Consumption and How Typical Was Yesterday's Eating\",\n       subtitle = \"NHANES National Youth Fitness Survey, no survey weighting\")\n\n\n\n\nNote the use of the %>% pipe here.

Most comparison boxplots, as we’ll see below, are oriented vertically.\n\nThe boxplot’s whiskers that are drawn from the first and third quartiles (i.e. the 25th and 75th percentiles) out to the most extreme points in the data that do not meet the standard of ``candidate outliers.’’ An outlier is simply a point that is far away from the center of the data - which may be due to any number of reasons, and generally indicates a need for further investigation.\nMost software, including R, uses a standard proposed by Tukey which describes a ``candidate outlier’’ as any point above the upper fence or below the lower fence. The definitions of the fences are based on the inter-quartile range (IQR).\nIf IQR = 75th percentile - 25th percentile, then the upper fence is 75th percentile + 1.5 IQR, and the lower fence is 25th percentile - 1.5 IQR.\nSo for these energy data,\n\nthe upper fence is located at 2306 + 1.5(938.5) = 3713.75\nthe lower fence is located at 1367 - 1.5(938.5) = -40.75\n\nIn this case, we see no points identified as outliers in the low part of the distribution, but quite a few identified that way on the high side. This tends to identify about 5% of the data as a candidate outlier, if the data follow a Normal distribution.\n\nThis plot is indicating clearly that there is some asymmetry (skew) in the data, specifically right skew.\nThe standard R uses is to indicate as outliers any points that are more than 1.5 inter-quartile ranges away from the edges of the box.\n\nThe horizontal orientation I’ve chosen here clarifies the relationship of direction of skew to the plot. A plot like this, with multiple outliers on the right side is indicative of a long right tail in the distribution, and hence, positive or right skew - with the mean being larger than the median. Other indications of skew include having one side of the box being substantially wider than the other, or one side of the whiskers being substantially longer than the other. More on skew later."

Many models assume a Normal distribution, where, among other things, the data are symmetric around the mean.\nSkewness measures asymmetry in the distribution, where left skew (mean < median) is indicated by negative skewness values, while right skew (mean > median) is indicated by positive values. The skew value will be near zero for data that follow a symmetric distribution.\n\n9.13.1 Non-parametric Skewness\nA simpler measure of skew, sometimes called the nonparametric skew and closely related to Pearson’s notion of median skewness, falls between -1 and +1 for any distribution.

    "text": "9.14 Assessing Kurtosis (Heavy-Tailedness)\nAnother measure of a distribution’s shape that can be found in the psych library is the kurtosis. Kurtosis is an indicator of whether the distribution is heavy-tailed or light-tailed as compared to a Normal distribution. Positive kurtosis means more of the variance is due to outliers - unusual points far away from the mean relative to what we might expect from a Normally distributed data set with the same standard deviation.\n\nA Normal distribution will have a kurtosis value near 0, a distribution with similar tail behavior to what we would expect from a Normal is said to be mesokurtic\nHigher kurtosis values (meaningfully higher than 0) indicate that, as compared to a Normal distribution, the observed variance is more the result of extreme outliers (i.e. heavy tails) as opposed to being the result of more modest sized deviations from the mean. These heavy-tailed, or outlier prone, distributions are sometimes called leptokurtic.\nKurtosis values meaningfully lower than 0 indicate light-tailed data, with fewer outliers than we’d expect in a Normal distribution. Such distributions are sometimes referred to as platykurtic, and include distributions without outliers, like the Uniform distribution.\n\nHere’s a table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFewer outliers than a Normal\nApproximately Normal\nMore outliers than a Normal\n\n\n\n\nLight-tailed\n“Normalish”\nHeavy-tailed\n\n\nplatykurtic (kurtosis < 0)\nmesokurtic (kurtosis = 0)\nleptokurtic (kurtosis > 0)\n\n\n\n\npsych::kurtosi(nnyfs$energy)\n\n[1] 1.130539\n\n\nNote that the kurtosi() function is strangely named, and is part of the psych package.\n\n9.14.1 The Standard Error of the Sample Mean\nThe standard error of the sample mean, which is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size:\n\nsd(nnyfs$energy)/sqrt(length(nnyfs$energy))\n\n[1] 18.54018"

Bock, Velleman and DeVeaux provide some useful advice:\n\nIf the data are skewed, report the median and IQR (or the three middle quantiles). You may want to include the mean and standard deviation, but you should point out why the mean and median differ. The fact that the mean and median do not agree is a sign that the distribution may be skewed. A histogram will help you make that point.\nIf the data are symmetric, report the mean and standard deviation, and possibly the median and IQR as well.\nIf there are clear outliers and you are reporting the mean and standard deviation, report them with the outliers present and with the outliers removed. The differences may be revealing. The median and IQR are not likely to be seriously affected by outliers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWickham, Hadley, and Garrett Grolemund. 2022. R for Data Science. Second.

The minimum body-mass index, 257 is 2.24 standard deviations below the mean, so it has a Z score of -2.2.\nRecall that the Empirical Rule suggests that if a variable follows a Normal distribution, it would have approximately 95% of its observations falling inside a Z score of (-2, 2), and 99.74% falling inside a Z score range of (-3, 3).\n\n10.4.1 Fences and Z Scores\nNote the relationship between the fences (Tukey’s approach to identifying points which fall within the whiskers of a boxplot, as compared to candidate outliers) and the Z scores.\nThe upper inner fence in this case falls at 3713.75, which indicates a Z score of 2.5, while the lower inner fence falls at -40.25, which indicates a Z score of -2.7.

The idea of a normal Q-Q plot is that it plots the observed sample values (on the vertical axis) and then, on the horizontal, the expected or theoretical quantiles that would be observed in a standard normal distribution (a Normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1) with the same number of observations.\nA Normal Q-Q plot will follow a straight line when the data are (approximately) Normally distributed.

If x is a count of something that could be zero, we often simply add 1 to x before transformation.\n\nThe ladder of power transformations is particularly helpful when we are confronted with data that shows skew.\n\nTo handle right skew (where the mean exceeds the median) we usually apply powers below 1.\nTo handle left skew (where the median exceeds the mean) we usually apply powers greater than 1.\n\nThe most common transformations are the square (power 2), the square root (power 1/2), the logarithm (power 0) and the inverse (power -1), and I usually restrict myself to those options in practical work."

If we want to use the tools of the Normal distribution to describe these data, we might try taking a step “down” our ladder from power 1 (raw data) to lower powers.\n\n10.13.1 The Square Root\nWould a square root applied to the protein data help alleviate that right skew?\n\nres <- mosaic::favstats(~ sqrt(protein), data = nnyfs)\nbin_w <- 1 # specify binwidth\n\np1 <- ggplot(nnyfs, aes(x = sqrt(protein))) +\n    geom_histogram(binwidth = bin_w, \n                   fill = \"salmon\", \n                   col = \"white\") +\n    \n    stat_function(\n        fun = function(x) dnorm(x, mean = res$mean, \n                                sd = res$sd) * \n            res$n * bin_w,\n        col = \"darkred\", size = 2) +\n    labs(title = \"Histogram with Normal fit\", \n         x = \"Square Root of Protein Consumption (g)\", y = \"# of subjects\")\n\n\np2 <- ggplot(nnyfs, aes(sample = sqrt(protein))) +\n    geom_qq(col = \"salmon\") + \n    geom_qq_line(col = \"black\") +\n    \n    labs(title = \"Normal Q-Q plot\",\n         y = \"Square Root of Protein Consumption (g)\")\n\np3 <- ggplot(nnyfs, aes(x = \"\", y = sqrt(protein))) +\n    geom_violin() +\n    geom_boxplot(width = 0.2, fill = \"salmon\", \n                 outlier.color = \"red\") +\n    \n    coord_flip() +\n    labs(title = \"Boxplot with Violin\",\n         x = \"\", y = \"Square Root of Protein Consumption (g)\")\n\np1 + p2 - p3 + plot_layout(ncol = 1, height = c(3, 1)) +\n    plot_annotation(title = \"Square Root of NNYFS Protein Consumption\")\n\n\n\n\nThat looks like a more symmetric distribution, certainly, although we still have some outliers on the right side of the distribution. Should we take another step down the ladder?\n\n\n10.13.2 The Logarithm\nWe might also try a logarithm of the energy circumference data. We can use either the natural logarithm (log, in R) or the base-10 logarithm (log10, in R) - either will have the same impact on skew.\n\nres <- mosaic::favstats(~ log(protein), data = nnyfs)\nbin_w <- 0.5 # specify binwidth\n\np1 <- ggplot(nnyfs, aes(x = log(protein))) +\n    geom_histogram(binwidth = bin_w, \n                   fill = \"salmon\", \n                   col = \"white\") +\n    stat_function(\n        fun = function(x) dnorm(x, mean = res$mean, \n                                sd = res$sd) * \n            res$n * bin_w,\n        col = \"darkred\", size = 2) +\n    labs(title = \"Histogram with Normal fit\", \n         x = \"Log of Protein Consumption (g)\", y = \"# of subjects\")\n\n\np2 <- ggplot(nnyfs, aes(sample = log(protein))) +\n    geom_qq(col = \"salmon\") + \n    geom_qq_line(col = \"black\") +\n    labs(title = \"Normal Q-Q plot\",\n         y = \"Log of Protein Consumption (g)\")\n\np3 <- ggplot(nnyfs, aes(x = \"\", y = log(protein))) +\n    geom_violin() +\n    geom_boxplot(width = 0.2, fill = \"salmon\", \n                 outlier.color = \"red\") +\n    coord_flip() +\n    labs(title = \"Boxplot with Violin\",\n         x = \"\", y = \"Log of Protein Consumption (g)\")\n\np1 + p2 - p3 + plot_layout(ncol = 1, height = c(3, 1)) +\n    plot_annotation(title = \"Logarithm of NNYFS Protein Consumption\")\n\n\n\n\nNow, it looks like we may have gone too far in the other direction. It looks like the square root is a sensible choice to try to improve the fit of a Normal model to the protein consumption data.\n\n\n10.13.3 This course uses Natural Logarithms, unless otherwise specified\nIn this course, we will assume the use of natural logarithms unless we specify otherwise. Following R’s convention, we will use log for natural logarithms."

    "text": "11.2 Assessing A Scatterplot\nLet’s consider the relationship of protein and fat consumption for children in the nnyfs data.\n\nnnyfs <- read_rds(\"data/nnyfs.Rds\")\n\nWe’ll begin our investigation, as we always should, by drawing a relevant picture. For the association of two quantitative variables, a scatterplot is usually the right start. Each subject in the nnyfs data is represented by one of the points below. To the plot, I’ve also used geom_smooth to add a straight line regression model, which we’ll discuss later.\n\nggplot(data = nnyfs, aes(x = protein, y = fat)) +\n    geom_point(shape = 1, size = 2, col = \"sienna\") +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE, col = \"steelblue\") +\n    labs(title = \"Protein vs. Fat consumption\",\n         subtitle = \"Children in the NNYFS data, with fitted straight line regression model\",\n         x = \"Protein (in g)\", y = \"Fat (in g)\")\n\n\n\n\nHere, I’ve arbitrarily decided to place fat on the vertical axis, and protein on the horizontal. Fitting a prediction model to this scatterplot will then require that we predict fat on the basis of protein.\nIn this case, the pattern appears to be:\n\ndirect, or positive, in that the values of the \\(x\\) variable (protein) increase, so do the values of the \\(y\\) variable (fat). Essentially, it appears that subjects who consumed more protein also consumed more fat, but we don’t know cause and effect here.\nfairly linear in that most of the points cluster around what appears to be a pattern which is well-fitted by a straight line.\nmoderately strong in that the range of values for fat associated with any particular value of protein is fairly tight. If we know someone’s protein consumption, that should meaningfully improve our ability to predict their fat consumption, among the subjects in these data.\nthat we see some unusual or outlier values, further away from the general pattern of most subjects shown in the data.\n\n\n11.2.1 Highlighting an unusual point\nConsider the subject with protein consumption close to 200 g, whose fat consumption is below 100 g. That’s well below the prediction of the linear model for example. We can identify the subject because it is the only person with protein > 190 and fat < 100 with BMI > 35 and waist.circ < 70. So I’ll create a subset of the nnyfs data containing the point that meets that standard, and then add a red point and a label to the plot.\n\n# identify outlier and place it in data frame s1 \ns1 <- filter(nnyfs, protein > 190 & fat < 100)\n\nggplot(data = nnyfs, aes(x = protein, y = fat)) +\n    geom_point(shape = 1, size = 2, col = \"sienna\") +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, formula = y ~ x, col = \"steelblue\") +\n    geom_point(data = s1, size = 2, col = \"red\") +\n    geom_text(data = s1, label = s1$SEQN, \n              vjust = -1, col = \"red\") +\n    labs(title = \"Protein vs. Fat consumption in NNYFS\",\n         subtitle = \"with regression line, and an outlier labeled by SEQN\",\n         x = \"Protein (in g)\", y = \"Fat (in g)\")\n\n\n\n\nWhile this subject is hardly the only unusual point in the data set, it is one of the more unusual ones, in terms of its vertical distance from the regression line. We can identify the subject by printing (part of) the tibble we created.\n\ns1 |> select(SEQN, sex, race_eth, age_child, protein, fat) |> kable()\n\n\n\n\nSEQN\nsex\nrace_eth\nage_child\nprotein\nfat\n\n\n\n\n71919\nFemale\n2_White Non-Hispanic\n14\n199.33\n86.08\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, does it seem to you like a straight line model will describe this protein-fat relationship well?\n\n\n11.2.2 Adding a Scatterplot Smooth using loess\nNext, we’ll use the loess procedure to fit a smooth curve to the data, which attempts to capture the general pattern.\n\nggplot(data = nnyfs, aes(x = protein, y = fat)) +\n    geom_point(shape = 1, size = 2, col = \"sienna\") +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, formula = y ~ x, col = \"red\") +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, formula = y ~ x, col = \"steelblue\") +\n    labs(title = \"Protein vs. Fat consumption in NNYFS\",\n         subtitle = \"with loess smooth (red) and linear fit (blue)\",\n         x = \"Protein (in g)\", y = \"Fat (in g)\")\n\n\n\n\nThis “loess” smooth curve is fairly close to the straight line fit, indicating that perhaps a linear regression model might fit the data well.\nA loess smooth is a method of fitting a local polynomial regression model that R uses as its default smooth for scatterplots with fewer than 1000 observations. Think of the loess as a way of fitting a curve to data by tracking (at point x) the points within a neighborhood of point x, with more emphasis given to points near x. It can be adjusted by tweaking two specific parameters, in particular:\n\na span parameter (defaults to 0.75) which is also called \\(\\alpha\\) in the literature, that controls the degree of smoothing (essentially, how large the neighborhood should be), and\na degree parameter (defaults to 2) which specifies the degree of polynomial to be used. Normally, this is either 1 or 2 - more complex functions are rarely needed for simple scatterplot smoothing.\n\nIn addition to the curve, smoothing procedures can also provide confidence intervals around their main fitted line.

As with any straight line, our model equation requires us to specify two parameters: a slope and an intercept (sometimes called the y-intercept.)\nTo identify the equation R used to fit this line (using the method of least squares), we use the lm command\n\nlm(fat ~ protein, data = nnyfs)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = fat ~ protein, data = nnyfs)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)      protein  \n    18.8945       0.7251  \n\n\nSo the fitted line is specified as\n\\[\n\\mbox{fat} = 18.8945 + 0.7251 \\mbox{ protein }\n\\]\nA detailed summary of the fitted linear regression model is also available.\n\nsummary(lm(fat ~ protein, data = nnyfs))\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = fat ~ protein, data = nnyfs)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-77.798 -14.841  -2.449  13.601 110.597 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

Specifically, we expect that for every additional gram of protein consumed, the fat consumption will be 0.725 gram larger.\nThe multiple R-squared (squared correlation coefficient) is 0.445, which implies that 44.5% of the variation in fat is explained using this linear model with protein.\nThis also implies that the Pearson correlation between fat and protein is the square root of 0.445, or 0.667. More on the Pearson correlation soon.\n\nSo, if we plan to use a simple (least squares) linear regression model to describe fat consumption as a function of protein consumption in the NNYFS data, does it look like a least squares (or linear regression) model will be an effective choice?"

If Danielle were our real data, we might well think that x would be of little use in predicting y.\n\nBut what if our data looked like Earl? In the Earl data set, x is incredibly helpful in predicting y, but we can’t use a straight line model - instead, we need a non-linear modeling approach.\nYou’ll recall that the Fiona data set also had a Pearson correlation of zero. But here, the picture is rather more interesting.\n\nSo, remember, draw the appropriate scatterplot whenever you make use of a correlation coefficient.\n\nrm(setA, setB, setBC, tab1)"

    "text": "11.7 The Spearman Rank Correlation\nThe Spearman rank correlation coefficient is a rank-based measure of statistical dependence that assesses how well the relationship between X and Y can be described using a monotone function even if that relationship is not linear.\n\nA monotone function preserves order, that is, Y must either be strictly increasing as X increases, or strictly decreasing as X increases.\nA Spearman correlation of 1.0 indicates simply that as X increases, Y always increases.\nLike the Pearson correlation, the Spearman correlation is dimension-free, and falls between -1 and +1.\nA positive Spearman correlation corresponds to an increasing (but not necessarily linear) association between X and Y, while a negative Spearman correlation corresponds to a decreasing (but again not necessarily linear) association.\n\n\n11.7.1 Spearman Formula\nTo calculate the Spearman rank correlation, we take the ranks of the X and Y data, and then apply the usual Pearson correlation. To find the ranks, sort X and Y into ascending order, and then number them from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). In the event of a tie, assign the average rank to the tied subjects.\n\n\n11.7.2 Comparing Pearson and Spearman Correlations\nLet’s look at the nnyfs data again.\n\nnnyfs |> select(fat, protein) |> cor()\n\n              fat   protein\nfat     1.0000000 0.6671209\nprotein 0.6671209 1.0000000\n\nnnyfs |> select(fat, protein) %>% cor(., method = \"spearman\")\n\n              fat   protein\nfat     1.0000000 0.6577489\nprotein 0.6577489 1.0000000\n\n\nThe Spearman and Pearson correlations are not especially different in this case.\n\n\n11.7.3 Spearman vs. Pearson Example 1\nThe next few plots describe relationships where we anticipate the Pearson and Spearman correlations might differ in their conclusions.\n\nspear1 <- read_csv(\"data/spear1.csv\")\n\nRows: 22 Columns: 2\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\ndbl (2): x, y\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\nspear2 <- read_csv(\"data/spear2.csv\")\n\nRows: 90 Columns: 2\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\ndbl (2): x, y\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\nspear3 <- read_csv(\"data/spear3.csv\")\n\nRows: 55 Columns: 2\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\ndbl (2): x, y\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\nspear4 <- read_csv(\"data/spear4.csv\")\n\nRows: 15 Columns: 2\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\ndbl (2): x, y\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n# these are just toy examples with\n# two columns per data set and no row numbering\n\nExample 1 shows a function where the Pearson correlation is 0.925 (a strong but not perfect linear relation), but the Spearman correlation is 1 because the relationship is monotone, even though it is not perfectly linear.\n\nggplot(spear1, aes(x = x, y = y)) + \n    geom_point() +\n    labs(title = \"Spearman vs. Pearson, Example 1\") +\n    annotate(\"text\", x = -10, y = 20, \n             label = paste(\"Pearson r = \", \n                 signif(cor(spear1$x, spear1$y),2),\n                 \", Spearman r = \", \n                 signif(cor(spear1$x, spear1$y, method = \"spearman\"),2)))\n\n\n\n\nSo, a positive Spearman correlation corresponds to an increasing (but not necessarily linear) association between x and y.\n\n\n11.7.4 Spearman vs. Pearson Example 2\nExample 2 shows that a negative Spearman correlation corresponds to a decreasing (but, again, not necessarily linear) association between x and y.\n\nggplot(spear2, aes(x = x, y = y)) + \n    geom_point(col = \"purple\") +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE) +\n    labs(title = \"Spearman vs. Pearson, Example 2\") +\n    annotate(\"text\", x = 10, y = 20, col = \"purple\",\n             label = paste(\"Pearson r = \", \n                    signif(cor(spear2$x, spear2$y),2),\n                    \", Spearman r = \", \n                    signif(cor(spear2$x, spear2$y, method = \"spearman\"),2)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.7.5 Spearman vs. Pearson Example 3\nThe Spearman correlation is less sensitive than the Pearson correlation is to strong outliers that are unusual on either the X or Y axis, or both. That is because the Spearman rank coefficient limits the outlier to the value of its rank.\nIn Example 3, for instance, the Spearman correlation reacts much less to the outliers around X = 12 than does the Pearson correlation.\n\nggplot(spear3, aes(x = x, y = y)) + \n    geom_point(col = \"blue\") +\n    labs(title = \"Spearman vs. Pearson, Example 3\") +\n    annotate(\"text\", x = 5, y = -15, col = \"blue\",\n             label = paste(\"Pearson r = \", \n                signif(cor(spear3$x, spear3$y),2),\n                \", Spearman r = \", \n                signif(cor(spear3$x, spear3$y, method = \"spearman\"),2)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.7.6 Spearman vs. Pearson Example 4\nThe use of a Spearman correlation is no substitute for looking at the data. For non-monotone data like what we see in Example 4, neither the Spearman nor the Pearson correlation alone provides much guidance, and just because they are (essentially) telling you the same thing, that doesn’t mean what they’re telling you is all that helpful.\n\nggplot(spear4, aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n    geom_point(col = \"purple\") +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE) +\n    labs(title = \"Spearman vs. Pearson, Example 4\") +\n    annotate(\"text\", x = 10, y = 20, col = \"purple\",\n             label = paste(\"Pearson r = \", \n                 signif(cor(spear4$x, spear4$y),2),\n                 \", Spearman r = \", \n                 signif(cor(spear4$x, spear4$y, method = \"spearman\"),2)))"

    "text": "12.2 “Linearize” The Association between Quantitative Variables\nConfronted with a scatterplot describing a monotone association between two quantitative variables, we may decide the data are not well approximated by a straight line, and thus, that a least squares regression may not be not sufficiently useful. In these circumstances, we have at least two options, which are not mutually exclusive:\n\nLet the data be as they may, and summarize the scatterplot using tools like loess curves, polynomial functions, or cubic splines to model the relationship.\nConsider re-expressing the data (often we start with re-expressions of the outcome data [the Y variable]) using a transformation so that the transformed data may be modeled effectively using a straight line."

We can rescale the Y data by adding a constant to every observation in a data set without changing shape.\nWe can use a natural logarithm (log in R), a base 10 logarithm (log10) or even sometimes a base 2 logarithm (log2) to good effect in Tukey’s ladder. All affect the association’s shape in the same way, so we’ll stick with log (base e).\nSome re-expressions don’t lead to easily interpretable results. Not many things that make sense in their original units also make sense in inverse square roots. There are times when we won’t care, but often, we will.\nIf our primary interest is in making predictions, we’ll generally be more interested in getting good predictions back on the original scale, and we can back-transform the point and interval estimates to accomplish this."

It does look a bit less curved, and a bit more like a random cluster of points, so that’s nice. Usually, we can do a little better in real data, as shown in the next example from the NNYFS data we introduced in Chapter @ref(NYFS-Study)."

    "text": "13.4 The loess smooth\nWe can obtain a smoothed curve (using several different approaches) to summarize the pattern presented by the data in any scatterplot. For instance, we might build such a plot for the complete set of 38 crabs, adding in a non-linear smooth function (called a loess smooth.)\n\nggplot(crabs, aes(x = height, y = force)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, formula = y ~ x) +\n    labs(title = \"Crab Claw Force by Size\", \n         x = \"Claw's propodus height (mm)\", y = \"Mean closing force (N)\")\n\n\n\n\nAs we have discussed previously, a loess smooth fits a curve to data by tracking (at point x) the points within a neighborhood of point x, with more emphasis given to points near x. It can be adjusted by tweaking the span and degree parameters.\nIn addition to the curve, smoothing procedures can also provide confidence intervals around their main fitted line. Consider the following plot of the crabs information, which adjusts the span (from its default of 0.75) and also adds in the confidence intervals.\n\nggplot(crabs, aes(x = height, y = force)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", formula = y ~ x, span = 0.5, se = TRUE) +\n    labs(title = \"Crab Claw Force by Size\", \n         x = \"Claw's propodus height (mm)\", y = \"Mean closing force (N)\")\n\n\n\n\nBy reducing the size of the span, our resulting picture shows a much less smooth function that we generated previously.\n\n13.4.1 Smoothing within Species\nWe can, of course, produce the plot above with separate smooths for each of the three species of crab.\n\nggplot(crabs, aes(x = height, y = force, group = species, color = species)) +\n    geom_point(size = 3) +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE) +\n    labs(title = \"Crab Claw Force by Size\", \n         x = \"Claw's propodus height (mm)\", y = \"Mean closing force (N)\")\n\n\n\n\nIf we want to add in the confidence intervals (here I’ll show them at 90% rather than the default of 95%) then this plot should be faceted. Note that by default, what is displayed when se = TRUE are 95% prediction intervals - the level function in stat_smooth [which can be used in place of geom_smooth] is used here to change the coverage percentage from 95% to 90%.\n\nggplot(crabs, aes(x = height, y = force, group = species, color = species)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    stat_smooth(method = \"loess\", formula = y ~ x, level = 0.90, se = TRUE) +\n    guides(color = \"none\") +\n    labs(title = \"Crab Claw Force by Size\", \n         caption = \"with loess smooths and 90% confidence intervals\",\n         x = \"Claw's propodus height (mm)\", y = \"Mean closing force (N)\") +\n    facet_wrap(~ species)\n\n\n\n\nMore on these and other confidence intervals later, especially in part B."

Specifically, we expect that for every additional mm of height, the force will increase by 2.63 Newtons.\nThe multiple R-squared (squared correlation coefficient) is 0.427, which implies that 42.7% of the variation in force is explained using this linear model with height. It also implies that the Pearson correlation between force and height is the square root of 0.427, or 0.653."

If we wanted dose to be treated as a factor, we’d have specified that in the model.\n\n\n\n\n14.9.2 Residual Summary\n\nThe second part of the output summarizes the regression residuals across the subjects involved in fitting the model.\n\nThe residual is defined as the Actual value of our outcome minus the predicted value of that outcome fitted by the model.\nIn our case, the residual for a given child is their actual recov.score minus the predicted recov.score according to our model, for that child.\nThe residual summary gives us a sense of how “incorrect” our predictions are for the hydrate observations.\n\nA positive residual means that the observed value was higher than the predicted value from the linear regression model, so the prediction was too low.\nA negative residual means that the observed value was lower than the predicted value from the linear regression model, so the prediction was too high.\nThe residuals will center near 0 (the ordinary least squares model fitting process is designed so the mean of the residuals will always be zero)\nWe hope to see the median of the residuals also be near zero, generally. In this case, the median prediction is 0.06 point too low.\nThe minimum and maximum show us the largest prediction errors, made in the subjects used to fit this model.\nHere, we predicted a recovery score that was 22.3 points too high for one patient, and another of our predicted recovery scores was 23.9 points too low.\nThe middle half of our predictions were between 8.4 points too low and 7.3 points too high.\n\n\n\n\n\n14.9.3 Coefficients Output\n\nThe Coefficients output begins with a table of the estimated coefficients from the regression equation.\n\nGenerally, we write a simple regression model as \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\).\nIn the hydrate model, we have recov.score = \\(\\beta_0\\) + \\(\\beta_1\\) dose.\nThe first column of the table gives the estimated \\(\\beta\\) coefficients for our model\n\nHere the estimated intercept \\(\\hat{\\beta_0} = 63.9\\)\nThe estimated slope of dose \\(\\hat{\\beta_1} = 4.88\\)\nThus, our model is recov.score= 63.9 + 4.88 dose\n\n\n\nWe interpret these coefficients as follows:\n\nThe intercept (63.9) is the predicted recov.score for a patient receiving a dose of 0 mEq/l of the electrolytic solution.\nThe slope (4.88) of the dose is the predicted change in recov.score associated with a 1 mEq/l increase in the dose of electrolytic solution.\n\nEssentially, if we have two children like the ones studied here, and we give Roger a popsicle with dose X and Sarah a popsicle with dose X + 1, then this model predicts that Sarah will have a recovery score that is 4.88 points higher than will Roger.\nFrom the confidence interval output we saw previously with the function confint(lm(recov.score ~ dose)), we are 95% confident that the true slope for dose is between (0.47, 9.30) mEq/l. We are also 95% confident that the true intercept is between (55.8, 72.0).\n\n\n\n\n14.9.4 Correlation and Slope\nIf we like, we can use the cor function to specify the Pearson correlation of recov.score and dose, which turns out to be 0.36. - Note that the slope in a simple regression model will follow the sign of the Pearson correlation coefficient, in this case, both will be positive.\n\nhydrate |> select(recov.score, dose) |> cor()\n\n            recov.score     dose\nrecov.score    1.000000 0.359528\ndose           0.359528 1.000000\n\n\n\n\n14.9.5 Coefficient Testing\n\nsummary(lm(recov.score ~ dose, data = hydrate))\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = recov.score ~ dose, data = hydrate)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-22.3360  -7.2763   0.0632   8.4233  23.9028 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

That’s not saying much, actually.\n\n\n14.9.6 Summarizing the Quality of Fit\n\nThe next part of the regression summary output is a summary of fit quality.\n\nThe residual standard error estimates the standard deviation of the prediction errors made by the model.\n\nIf assumptions hold, the model will produce residuals that follow a Normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation equal to this residual standard error.\n\nSo we’d expect roughly 95% of our residuals to fall between -2(12.21) and +2(12.21), or roughly -24.4 to +24.4 and that we’d see virtually no residuals outside the range of -3(12.21) to +3(12.21), or roughly -36.6 to +36.6.\nThe output at the top of the summary tells us about the observed regression residuals, and that they actually range from -22 to +24.\nIn context, it’s hard to know whether or not we should be happy about this. On a scale from 0 to 100, rarely missing by more than 24 seems OK to me, but not terrific.\n\nThe degrees of freedom here are the same as the denominator degrees of freedom in the ANOVA to follow. The calculation is \\(n - k\\), where \\(n\\) = the number of observations and \\(k\\) is the number of coefficients estimated by the regression (including the intercept and any slopes).\n\nHere, there are 36 observations in the model, and we fit k = 2 coefficients; the slope and the intercept, as in any simple regression model, so df = 36 - 2 = 34.\n\n\nThe multiple R-squared value is usually just referred to as R-squared.\n\nThis is interpreted as the proportion of variation in the outcome variable that has been accounted for by our regression model.\n\nHere, we’ve accounted for just under 13% of the variation in % Recovery using Dose.\n\nThe R in multiple R-squared is the Pearson correlation of recov.score and dose, which in this case is 0.3595.\n\nSquaring this value gives the R-squared for this simple regression.\n(0.3595)^2 = 0.129\n\n\nR-squared is greedy.\n\nR-squared will always suggest that we make our models as big as possible, often including variables of dubious predictive value.\nAs a result, there are various methods for adjusting or penalizing R-squared so that we wind up with smaller models.\nThe adjusted R-squared is often a useful way to compare multiple models for the same response.\n\n\\(R^2_{adj} = 1 - \\frac{(1-R^2)(n - 1)}{n - k}\\), where \\(n\\) = the number of observations and \\(k\\) is the number of coefficients estimated by the regression (including the intercept and any slopes).\nSo, in this case, \\(R^2_{adj} = 1 - \\frac{(1 - 0.1293)(35)}{34} = 0.1037\\)\nThe adjusted R-squared value is not, technically, a proportion of anything, but it is comparable across models for the same outcome.\nThe adjusted R-squared will always be less than the (unadjusted) R-squared.\n\n\n\n\n14.9.7 ANOVA F test\n\nThe last part of the standard summary of a regression model is the overall ANOVA F test.\n\nThe hypotheses for this test are:\n\nH0: Each of the coefficients in the model (other than the intercept) has \\(\\beta\\) = 0 vs.\nHA: At least one regression slope has \\(\\beta \\neq\\) 0\n\nSince we are doing a simple regression with just one predictor, the ANOVA F test hypotheses are exactly the same as the t test for dose:\n\nH0: The slope for dose has \\(\\beta\\) = 0 vs.\nHA: The slope for dose has \\(\\beta \\neq\\) 0\n\nIn this case, we have an F statistic of 5.05 on 1 and 34 degrees of freedom, yielding p = 0.03\nThis provides some evidence that “something” in our model (here, dose is the only predictor) predicts the outcome to a degree beyond that easily attributed to chance alone. This is not actually surprising, nor is it especially interesting. The confidence interval for the slope is definitely more interesting than this.\n\nIn simple regression (regression with only one predictor), the t test for the slope (dose) always provides the same p value as the ANOVA F test.\n\nThe F test statistic in a simple regression is always by definition just the square of the slope’s t test statistic.\nHere, F = 5.047, and this is the square of t = 2.247 from the Coefficients output\n\n\nThis test is basically just a combination of the R-squared value (13%) and the sample size. We don’t learn much from it that’s practically interesting or useful."

Two additional goals, developed later in the study, were (1) to investigate the comparability of formulas developed in WCGS and in the Framingham Study (FS) for prediction of CHD risk, and (2) to determine how addition of TABP to an existing multivariate prediction formula affects ability to select subjects for intervention programs.\n\nThe study enrolled over 3,000 men ages 39-59 who were employed in San Francisco or Los Angeles, during 1960 and 1961.\n\nwcgs <- read_csv(\"data/wcgs.csv\") |>\n    mutate(across(where(is.character), as_factor))\n\nwcgs\n\n# A tibble: 3,154 × 22\n      id   age agec  height weight lnwght wghtcat   bmi   sbp lnsbp   dbp  chol\n   <dbl> <dbl> <fct>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl> <fct>   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n 1  2343    50 46-50     67    200   5.30 170-200  31.3   132  4.88    90   249\n 2  3656    51 51-55     73    192   5.26 170-200  25.3   120  4.79    74   194\n 3  3526    59 56-60     70    200   5.30 170-200  28.7   158  5.06    94   258\n 4 22057    51 51-55     69    150   5.01 140-170  22.1   126  4.84    80   173\n 5 12927    44 41-45     71    160   5.08 140-170  22.3   126  4.84    80   214\n 6 16029    47 46-50     64    158   5.06 140-170  27.1   116  4.75    76   206\n 7  3894    40 35-40     70    162   5.09 140-170  23.2   122  4.80    78   190\n 8 11389    41 41-45     70    160   5.08 140-170  23.0   130  4.87    84   212\n 9 12681    50 46-50     71    195   5.27 170-200  27.2   112  4.72    70   130\n10 10005    43 41-45     68    187   5.23 170-200  28.4   120  4.79    80   233\n# … with 3,144 more rows, and 10 more variables: behpat <fct>, dibpat <fct>,\n#   smoke <fct>, ncigs <dbl>, arcus <dbl>, chd69 <fct>, typchd69 <dbl>,\n#   time169 <dbl>, t1 <dbl>, uni <dbl>\n# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows, and `colnames()` to see all variable names\n\n\nHere, we have 3154 rows (subjects) and 22 columns (variables).

One way to gauge this is to describe that observation’s Z score, the number of standard deviations away from the mean that the observation falls. Here, the maximum value, 230 is 6.71 standard deviations above the mean, and thus has a Z score of 6.7.\nA negative Z score would indicate a point below the mean, while a positive Z score indicates, as we’ve seen, a point above the mean. The minimum systolic blood pressure, 98 is 2.03 standard deviations below the mean, so it has a Z score of -2.\nRecall that the Empirical Rule suggests that if a variable follows a Normal distribution, it would have approximately 95% of its observations falling inside a Z score of (-2, 2), and 99.74% falling inside a Z score range of (-3, 3). Do the systolic blood pressures appear Normally distributed?"

A point estimate provides a single best guess as to the value of a population or process parameter.\nA confidence interval is a particularly useful way to convey to people just how much error one must allow for in a given estimate. In particular, a confidence interval allows us to quantify just how close we expect, for instance, the sample mean to be to the population or process mean. The computer will do the calculations; we need to interpret the results.\nThe key things that we will need to trade off are cost vs. precision, and precision vs. confidence in the correctness of the statement. Often, if we are dissatisfied with the width of the confidence interval and want to make it smaller, we have little choice but to reconsider the sample – larger samples produce shorter intervals."

The main goal for many of the parametric models that are a large part of statistics is to estimate population parameters, like a population mean, or regression coefficient, on the basis of a sample. When we do this, we want to describe not only our best guess at the parameter (referred to as a point estimate) but also say something useful about the uncertainty in our estimate, to let us more completely assess what the data have to tell us. A key tool for doing this is a confidence interval.\nEssentially every textbook on introductory statistics describes the development of a confidence interval, at least for a mean. Good supplemental resources are highlighted in the references I’ve provided in the course syllabus.\nWe’ll develop confidence intervals to compare parameters about two populations (either through matched pairs or independent samples) with confidence intervals soon. Here, we’ll consider the problem of estimating a confidence interval to describe the mean (or median) of the population represented by a single sample of quantitative data."

(Interval corresponding to a t test, and it will be a good choice when the data really are approximately Normally distributed.)\nA resampling approach to generate a bootstrap confidence interval for the population mean, which does not require that we assume either that the population standard deviation is known, nor that the data are drawn from an approximately Normal distribution, but which has some other weaknesses.\nA rank-based procedure called the Wilcoxon signed rank test can also be used to yield a confidence interval statement about the population pseudo-median, a measure of the population distribution’s center (but not the population’s mean)."

Suppose that we are also willing to assume that the 462 teenage males contained in the serzinc tibble are a random sample from that complete population. While we know the mean of the sample of 462 boys, we don’t know \\(\\mu\\), the mean across all teenage males. So we need to estimate it.\nEarlier we estimated that a 90% confidence interval for the mean serum zinc level (\\(\\mu\\)) across the entire population of teenage males was (86.71, 89.16) micrograms per deciliter. How should we interpret this result?\n\nSome people think this means that there is a 90% chance that the true mean of the population, \\(\\mu\\), falls between 86.71 and 89.16 micrograms per deciliter. That’s not correct.\nThe population mean is a constant parameter of the population of interest. That constant is not a random variable, and does not change. So the actual probability of the population mean falling inside that range is either 0 or 1.\nOur confidence is in our process.\n\nIt’s in the sampling method (random sampling) used to generate the data, and in the assumption that the population follows a Normal distribution.\nIt’s captured in our accounting for one particular type of error (called sampling error) in developing our interval estimate, while assuming all other potential sources of error are negligible.\n\n\nSo, what’s closer to the truth is:\n\nIf we used this same method to sample data from the true population of teenage males, and built 100 such 90% confidence intervals, then about 90 of them would contain the true population mean."

It is still possible that the results can be both:\n\ninaccurate (i.e. they can include the true value of the unknown population mean less often than the stated confidence probability) and\nimprecise (i.e., they can include more extraneous values of the unknown population mean than is desirable)."

    "text": "16.28 General Advice\nWe have described several approaches to estimating a confidence interval for the center of a distribution of quantitative data.\n\nThe most commonly used approach uses the t distribution to estimate a confidence interval for a population/process mean. This requires some extra assumptions, most particularly that the underlying distribution of the population values is at least approximately Normally distributed. This is identical to the result we get from an intercept-only linear regression model.\nA more modern and very general approach uses the idea of the bootstrap to estimate a confidence for a population/process parameter, which could be a mean, median or other summary statistic. The bootstrap, and the underlying notion of resampling is an important idea that lets us avoid some of the assumptions (in particular Normality) that are required by other methods. Bootstrap confidence intervals involve random sampling, so that the actual values obtained will differ a bit across replications.\nFinally, the Wilcoxon signed-rank method is one of a number of inferential tools which transform the data to their ranks before estimating a confidence interval. This avoids some assumptions, but yields inferences about a less-familiar parameter - the pseudo-median.\n\nMost of the time, the bootstrap provides a reasonably adequate confidence interval estimate of the population value of a parameter (mean or median, most commonly) from a distribution when our data consists of a single sample of quantitative information.\n\n\n\n\nPagano, Marcello, and Kimberlee Gauvreau. 2000.

    "text": "17.2 The Trial\nOur next study is a randomized controlled trial comparing ibuprofen vs. placebo in patients with sepsis, which uses an independent samples design to compare two samples of quantitative data. We will be working with a sample from the Ibuprofen in Sepsis study, which is also studied in Dupont (2002). Quoting the abstract from Bernard et al. (1997):\n\nIbuprofen has been shown to have effects on sepsis in humans, but because of their small samples (fewer than 30 patients), previous studies have been inadequate to assess effects on mortality. We sought to determine whether ibuprofen can alter rates of organ failure and mortality in patients with the sepsis syndrome, how the drug affects the increased metabolic demand in sepsis (e.g., fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxemia, and lactic acidosis), and what potential adverse effects the drug has in the sepsis syndrome.\n\nIn this study, patients meeting specific criteria (including elevated temperature) for a diagnosis of sepsis were recruited if they fulfilled an additional set of study criteria in the intensive care unit at one of seven participating centers.\nThe full trial involved 455 patients, of which our sample includes 300. 150 of our patients were randomly assigned to the Ibuprofen group and 150 to the Placebo group1. I picked the sepsis sample we will work with excluding patients with missing values for our outcome of interest, and then selected a random sample of 150 Ibuprofen and 150 Placebo patients from the rest of the group, and converted the temperatures and changes from Fahrenheit to Celsius. The data are gathered in the sepsis data file.\n\nsepsis <- read_csv(\"data/sepsis.csv\")\n\nFor the moment, we focus on two variables:\n\ntreat, which specifies the treatment group (intravenous Ibuprofen or intravenous Placebo), which was assigned via randomization to each patient, and\ntemp_drop, the outcome of interest, measured as the change from baseline to 2 hours later in degrees Celsius. Positive values indicate improvement, that is, a drop in temperature over the 2 hours following the baseline measurement.\n\nThe sepsis.csv file also contains each subject’s\n\nid, which is just a code\nrace (three levels: White, AfricanA or Other)\napache = baseline APACHE II score, a severity of disease score ranging from 0 to 71 with higher scores indicating more severe disease and a higher mortality risk\ntemp_0 = baseline temperature, degrees Celsius.\n\nbut for the moment, we won’t worry about those.\n\nsepsis <- sepsis |>\n    mutate(treat = factor(treat),\n           race = factor(race))\n\nsummary(sepsis)\n\n      id                  treat           race         apache    \n Length:300         Ibuprofen:150   AfricanA: 80   Min.   : 0.0  \n Class :character   Placebo  :150   Other   : 23   1st Qu.:10.0  \n Mode  :character                   White   :197   Median :14.0  \n                                                   Mean   :15.4  \n                                                   3rd Qu.:20.0  \n                                                   Max.   :35.0  \n     temp_0        temp_drop      \n Min.   :33.10   Min.   :-2.7000  \n 1st Qu.:37.48   1st Qu.:-0.1000  \n Median :38.20   Median : 0.3000  \n Mean   :38.00   Mean   : 0.3083  \n 3rd Qu.:38.70   3rd Qu.: 0.7000  \n Max.   :41.70   Max.   : 3.1000"

    "text": "17.3 Comparing Two Groups\nIn making a choice between two alternatives, questions such as the following become paramount.\n\nIs there a status quo?\nIs there a standard approach?\nWhat are the costs of incorrect decisions?\nAre such costs balanced?\n\nThe process of comparing the means/medians/proportions/rates of the populations represented by two independently obtained samples can be challenging, and such an approach is not always the best choice. Often, specially designed experiments can be more informative at lower cost (i.e. smaller sample size). As one might expect, using these more sophisticated procedures introduces trade-offs, but the costs are typically small relative to the gain in information.\nWhen faced with such a comparison of two alternatives, a test based on paired data is often much better than a test based on two distinct, independent samples. Why? If we have done our experiment properly, the pairing lets us eliminate background variation that otherwise hides meaningful differences.\n\n17.3.1 Model-Based Comparisons and ANOVA/Regression\nComparisons based on independent samples of quantitative variables are also frequently accomplished through other equivalent methods, including the analysis of variance approach and dummy variable regression, both of which produce identical confidence intervals to the pooled variance t test for the same comparison.\nWe will also discuss some of the main ideas in developing, designing and analyzing statistical experiments, specifically in terms of making comparisons. The ideas we will present in this section allow for the comparison of more than two populations in terms of their population means. The statistical techniques employed analyze the sample variance in order to test and estimate the population means and for this reason the method is called the analysis of variance (ANOVA), and we will discuss this approach alone, and within the context of a linear regression model using dummy or indicator variables."

    "text": "17.4 Key Questions for Comparing with Independent Samples\n\n17.4.1 What is the population under study?\n\nAll patients in the intensive care unit with sepsis who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study, at the entire population of health centers like the ones included in the trial.\n\n\n\n17.4.2 What is the sample? Is it representative of the population?\n\nThe sample consists of 300 patients. It is a convenient sample from the population under study.\nThis is a randomized clinical trial. 150 of the patients were assigned to Ibuprofen, and the rest to Placebo. It is this treatment assignment that is randomized, not the selection of the sample as a whole.\nIn expectation, randomization of individuals to treatments, as in this study, should be expected to eliminate treatment selection bias.\n\n\n\n17.4.3 Who are the subjects / individuals within the sample?\n\n150 patients who received Ibuprofen and a completely different set of 150 patients who received Placebo.\nThere is no match or link between the patients. They are best thought of as independent samples.\n\n\n\n17.4.4 What data are available on each individual?\n\nThe key variables are the treatment indicator (Ibuprofen or Placebo) and the outcome (drop in temperature in the 2 hours following administration of the randomly assigned treatment.)\n\n\n\n17.4.5 RCT Caveats\nThe placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized clinical trial, especially if pre-registered, is often considered the best feasible study for assessing the effectiveness of a treatment. While that’s not always true, it is a very solid design. The primary caveat is that the patients who are included in such trials are rarely excellent representations of the population of potentially affected patients as a whole."

Linear models usually summarize only the estimate and standard error. Remember that a reasonable approximation in large samples to a 95% confidence interval for a regression estimate (slope or intercept) can be obtained from estimate plus or minus two times the standard error.\n\ntidy(model1, conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95) |> kable(digits = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\nconf.low\nconf.high\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n0.464\n0.052\n8.991\n0\n0.362\n0.566\n\n\ntreatPlacebo\n-0.311\n0.073\n-4.266\n0\n-0.455\n-0.168\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, in the case of the treatPlacebo estimate, we can obtain an approximate 95% confidence interval with (-0.457, -0.165).

We’ll repeat those below.\n\nggplot(sepsis, aes(x = treat, y = temp_drop, fill = treat)) +\n    geom_violin() +\n    geom_boxplot(width = 0.3, fill = \"white\") +\n    scale_fill_viridis_d(alpha = 0.3) +\n    guides(fill = \"none\") + \n    labs(title = \"Boxplot of Temperature Drop in Sepsis Patients\",\n         x = \"\", y = \"Drop in Temperature (degrees C)\") + \n    coord_flip() \n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(sepsis, aes(sample = temp_drop)) +\n    geom_qq() + geom_qq_line(col = \"red\") +\n    facet_wrap(~ treat) + \n    labs(y = \"Temperature Drop Values (in degrees C)\")\n\n\n\n\nFrom these plots we conclude that the data in the Ibuprofen sample follow a reasonably Normal distribution, but this isn’t quite as true for the Placebo sample. It’s hard to know whether the apparent Placebo group outliers will affect whether the Normal distribution assumption is reasonable, so we can see if the confidence intervals change much when we don’t assume Normality (for instance, comparing the bootstrap to the t-based approaches), as a way of understanding whether a Normal model has a large impact on our conclusions.\n\n17.11.1 Sepsis Estimation Results\nHere’s a set of confidence interval estimates (we’ll use 90% confidence here) using the methods discussed in this Chapter.\n\nmosaic::favstats(temp_drop ~ treat, data = sepsis)\n\n      treat  min     Q1 median  Q3 max      mean        sd   n missing\n1 Ibuprofen -1.5  0.000    0.5 0.9 3.1 0.4640000 0.6877919 150       0\n2   Placebo -2.7 -0.175    0.1 0.4 1.9 0.1526667 0.5709637 150       0\n\n\n\ns_pooled_t_test <- t.test(temp_drop ~ treat, data = sepsis, conf.level = 0.90, \n                          alt = \"two.sided\", var.equal = TRUE)\n\ntidy(s_pooled_t_test) |> \n    select(conf.low, conf.high)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  conf.low conf.high\n     <dbl>     <dbl>\n1    0.191     0.432\n\n\n\ns_welch_t_test <- t.test(temp_drop ~ treat, data = sepsis, conf.level = 0.90,\n                         alt = \"two.sided\", var.equal = FALSE)\n\ntidy(s_welch_t_test) |> \n    select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  estimate conf.low conf.high\n     <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>\n1    0.311    0.191     0.432\n\n\n\ns_wilcoxon_test <- wilcox.test(temp_drop ~ treat, data = sepsis, \n                               conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.90,\n                               alt = \"two.sided\") \n\ntidy(s_wilcoxon_test) |> \n    select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  estimate conf.low conf.high\n     <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>\n1    0.300    0.200     0.400\n\n\n\nset.seed(431212)\ns_bootstrap <- bootdif(sepsis$temp_drop, sepsis$treat, conf.level = 0.90)\n\ns_bootstrap\n\nMean Difference            0.05            0.95 \n     -0.3113333      -0.4313667      -0.1833000 \n\n\n\n\n\nProcedure\nCompares…\nPoint Estimate\n90% CI\n\n\n\n\nPooled t\nMeans\n0.311\n(0.191, 0.432)\n\n\nWelch t\nMeans\n0.311\n(0.191, 0.432)\n\n\nBootstrap\nMeans\n0.311\n(0.183, 0.431)\n\n\nWilcoxon rank sum\nPseudo-Medians\n0.3\n(0.2, 0.4)\n\n\n\nWhat conclusions can we draw in this setting?"

    "text": "18.3 The Lead in the Blood of Children Study\nMorton et al. (1982) studied the absorption of lead into the blood of children. This was a matched-sample study, where the exposed group of interest contained 33 children of parents who worked in a battery manufacturing factory (where lead was used) in the state of Oklahoma. Specifically, each child with a lead-exposed parent was matched to another child of the same age, exposure to traffic, and living in the same neighborhood whose parents did not work in lead-related industries. So the complete study had 66 children, arranged in 33 matched pairs. The outcome of interest, gathered from a sample of whole blood from each of the children, was lead content, measured in mg/dl.\nOne motivation for doing this study is captured in the Abstract from Morton et al. (1982).\n\nIt has been repeatedly reported that children of employees in a lead-related industry are at increased risk of lead absorption because of the high levels of lead found in the household dust of these workers.\n\nThe data are available in several places, including Table 5 of Pruzek and Helmreich (2009), in the BloodLead data set within the PairedData package in R, but we also make them available in the bloodlead.csv file. A table of the first few pairs of observations (blood lead levels for one child exposed to lead and the matched control) is shown below.\n\nbloodlead <- read_csv(\"data/bloodlead.csv\")\n\nRows: 33 Columns: 3\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): pair\ndbl (2): exposed, control\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\nbloodlead\n\n# A tibble: 33 × 3\n   pair  exposed control\n   <chr>   <dbl>   <dbl>\n 1 P01        38      16\n 2 P02        23      18\n 3 P03        41      18\n 4 P04        18      24\n 5 P05        37      19\n 6 P06        36      11\n 7 P07        23      10\n 8 P08        62      15\n 9 P09        31      16\n10 P10        34      18\n# … with 23 more rows\n# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows\n\n\n\nIn each pair, one child was exposed (to having a parent working in the factory) and the other was not.\nOtherwise, though, each child was very similar to its matched partner.\nThe data under exposed and control are the blood lead content, in mg/dl.\n\nOur primary goal will be to estimate the difference in lead content between the exposed and control children, and then use that sample estimate to make inferences about the difference in lead content between the population of all children like those in the exposed group and the population of all children like those in the control group.\n\n18.3.1 Our Key Questions for a Paired Samples Comparison\n\nWhat is the population under study?\n\n\nAll pairs of children living in Oklahoma near the factory in question, in which one had a parent working in a factory that exposed them to lead, and the other did not.\n\n\nWhat is the sample? Is it representative of the population?\n\n\nThe sample consists of 33 pairs of one exposed and one control child.\nThis is a case-control study, where the children were carefully enrolled to meet the design criteria. Absent any other information, we’re likely to assume that there is no serious bias associated with these pairs, and that assuming they represent the population effectively (and perhaps the broader population of kids whose parents work in lead-based industries more generally) may well be at least as reasonable as assuming they don’t.\n\n\nWho are the subjects / individuals within the sample?\n\n\nEach of our 33 pairs of children includes one exposed child and one unexposed (control) child.\n\n\nWhat data are available on each individual?\n\n\nThe blood lead content, as measured in mg/dl of whole blood.\n\n\n\n18.3.2 Lead Study Caveats\nNote that the children were not randomly selected from general populations of kids whose parents did and did not work in lead-based industries.\n\nTo make inferences to those populations, we must make strong assumptions to believe, for instance, that the sample of exposed children is as representative as a random sample of children with similar exposures across the world would be.\nThe researchers did have a detailed theory about how the exposed children might be at increased risk of lead absorption, and in fact as part of the study gathered additional information about whether a possible explanation might be related to the quality of hygiene of the parents (all of them were fathers, actually) who worked in the factory.\nThis is an observational study, so that the estimation of a causal effect between parental work in a lead-based industry and children’s blood lead content can be made, without substantial (and perhaps heroic) assumptions."

So we’ll make that change.\nAlso, we’d like to calculate the difference in lead content between the exposed and the control children in each pair, and we’ll save that within-pair difference in a variable called lead_diff.

One obvious way to tell if you have paired samples is that you can pair every single subject from one exposure group to a unique subject in the other exposure group. Everyone has to be paired, so the sample sizes will always be the same in the two groups.\nHere’s a summary of the paired differences.\n\nmosaic::favstats(~ lead_diff, data = bloodlead)\n\n min Q1 median Q3 max    mean       sd  n missing\n  -9  4     15 25  60 15.9697 15.86365 33       0\n\nbloodlead |> summarize(skew1 = \n                            (mean(lead_diff) - median(lead_diff)) / \n                            sd(lead_diff))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n   skew1\n   <dbl>\n1 0.0611\n\n\n\n\n18.4.2 Impact of Matching - Scatterplot and Correlation\nHere, the data are paired by the study through matching on neighborhood, age and exposure to traffic. Each individual child’s outcome value is part of a pair with the outcome value for his/her matching partner. We can see this pairing in several ways, perhaps by drawing a scatterplot of the pairs.\n\nggplot(bloodlead, aes(x = control, y = exposed)) +\n    geom_point(size = 2) + \n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE) +\n    geom_text(x = 20, y = 65, col = \"blue\", \n             label = \n                 paste(\"Pearson r = \",\n                       round(cor(bloodlead$control, bloodlead$exposed),2))) +\n    labs(title = \"Paired Samples in Blood Lead study\",\n         x = \"Blood Lead Content (mg/dl) in Control Child\",\n         y = \"Blood Lead Content (mg/dl) in Exposed Child\")\n\n\n\n\nEach point here represents a pair of observations, one from a control child, and one from the matched exposed child. If there is a strong linear relationship (usually with a positive slope, thus positive correlation) between the paired outcomes, then the pairing will be more helpful in terms of improving statistical power of the estimates we build than if there is a weak relationship.\n\nThe stronger the Pearson correlation coefficient, the more helpful pairing will be.\nHere, a straight line model using the control child’s blood lead content accounts for about 3.2% of the variation in blood lead content in the exposed child.\nAs it turns out, pairing will have only a modest impact here on the inferences we draw in the study. We still will treat the data as paired, despite this."

But we will run into trouble because one variable (blood lead content) is spread across multiple columns (control and exposed.) The solution is to “pivot” the tibble from its current format to build a new, tidy tibble. Because the data aren’t tidied here, so that we have one row for each subject and one column for each variable, we have to do some work to get them in that form for our usual plotting strategy to work well.\n\npivot_longer() “lengthens” the data, increasing the number of rows and decreasing the number of columns.\npivot_wider() performs the inverse of that transformation, “widening” the data.\n\nIn our original bloodlead data, if we drop the lead_diff addition we made, we have wide data, with each row representing two different subjects.\n\nhead(bloodlead_original, 3)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  pair  exposed control\n  <chr>   <dbl>   <dbl>\n1 P01        38      16\n2 P02        23      18\n3 P03        41      18\n\n\nAnd what we want to accomplish is to have one row for each subject, instead of one row for each pair of subjects. So we want to make the data longer.\n\nbloodlead_longer <- bloodlead_original |>\n    pivot_longer(\n        cols = -c(pair),\n        names_to = \"status\",\n        values_to = \"lead_level\")\n\nbloodlead_longer\n\n# A tibble: 66 × 3\n   pair  status  lead_level\n   <chr> <chr>        <dbl>\n 1 P01   exposed         38\n 2 P01   control         16\n 3 P02   exposed         23\n 4 P02   control         18\n 5 P03   exposed         41\n 6 P03   control         18\n 7 P04   exposed         18\n 8 P04   control         24\n 9 P05   exposed         37\n10 P05   control         19\n# … with 56 more rows\n# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows\n\n\nFor more on this approach (in this case, we’re making the data “longer” and its opposite would be be making the data “wider”), visit the Tidy data chapter in Wickham and Grolemund (2022) and the tidyr repository on Github at https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr.\nAnd now, we can plot as usual to compare the two samples.\nFirst, we’ll look at a boxplot, showing all of the data.\n\nggplot(bloodlead_longer, aes(x = status, y = lead_level)) +\n    geom_violin() +\n    geom_boxplot(aes(fill = status), width = 0.2) +\n    scale_fill_viridis_d(begin = 0.5) +\n    guides(fill = \"none\") + \n    coord_flip() +\n    labs(title = \"Boxplot of Lead Content in Exposed and Control kids\") \n\n\n\n\nWe’ll also look at a ridgeline plot, because Dr. Love likes them, even though they’re really more useful when we’re comparing more than two samples.\n\nggplot(bloodlead_longer, aes(x = lead_level, y = status, fill = status)) +\n    ggridges::geom_density_ridges(scale = 0.9) +\n    guides(fill = \"none\") + \n    labs(title = \"Lead Content in Exposed and Control kids\") +\n    ggridges::theme_ridges()\n\nPicking joint bandwidth of 4.01\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth the center and the spread of the distribution are substantially larger in the exposed group than in the controls.

Paired (or matched) data can arise in several ways.\n\nThe most common is a “pre-post” study where subjects are measured both before and after an exposure happens.\nIn observational studies, we often match up subjects who did and did not receive an exposure so as to account for differences on things like age, sex, race and other covariates. This is what happens in the Lead in the Blood of Children study.\n\nIf the data are from paired samples, we should (and in fact) must form paired differences, with no subject left unpaired.\n\nIf we cannot line up the data comparing two samples of quantitative data so that the links between the individual “treated” and “control” observations to form matched pairs are evident, then the data are not paired.\nIf the sample sizes were different, we’d know we have independent samples, because matched pairs requires that each subject in the “treated” group be matched to a single, unique member of the “control” group, and thus that we have exactly as many “treated” as “control” subjects.\nBut having as many subjects in one treatment group as the other (which is called a balanced design) is only necessary, and not sufficient, for us to conclude that matched pairs are used.\n\n\nAs Bock, Velleman, and De Veaux (2004) suggest,\n\n… if you know the data are paired, you can take advantage of that fact - in fact, you must take advantage of it. … You must decide whether the data are paired from understanding how they were collected and what they mean. … There is no test to determine whether the data are paired."

    "text": "18.9 t-based CI for Population Mean of Paired Differences\nIn R, there are at least five different methods for obtaining the t-based confidence interval for the population difference in means between paired samples. They are all mathematically identical. The key idea is to calculate the paired differences (exposed - control, for example) in each pair, and then treat the result as if it were a single sample and apply the methods developed for that situation earlier in these Notes.\n\n18.9.1 Method 1\nWe can use the single-sample approach, applied to the variable containing the paired differences. Let’s build a 90% two-sided confidence interval for the population mean of the difference in blood lead content across all possible pairs of an exposed (parent works in a lead-based industry) and a control (parent does not) child.\n\ntt1 <- t.test(bloodlead$lead_diff, conf.level = 0.90, \n                            alt = \"two.sided\")\n\ntt1\n\n\n    One Sample t-test\n\ndata:  bloodlead$lead_diff\nt = 5.783, df = 32, p-value = 2.036e-06\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0\n90 percent confidence interval:\n 11.29201 20.64738\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n  15.9697 \n\ntidy(tt1) |> kable(digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nestimate\nstatistic\np.value\nparameter\nconf.low\nconf.high\nmethod\nalternative\n\n\n\n\n15.97\n5.78\n0\n32\n11.29\n20.65\nOne Sample t-test\ntwo.sided\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 90% confidence interval is (11.29, 20.65) according to this t-based procedure. An appropriate interpretation of the 90% two-sided confidence interval would be:\n\n(11.29, 20.65) milligrams per deciliter is a 90% two-sided confidence interval for the population mean difference in blood lead content between exposed and control children.\nOur point estimate for the true population difference in mean blood lead content is 15.97 mg.dl. The values in the interval (11.29, 20.65) mg/dl represent a reasonable range of estimates for the true population difference in mean blood lead content, and we are 90% confident that this method of creating a confidence interval will produce a result containing the true population mean difference.\nWere we to draw 100 samples of 33 matched pairs from the population described by this sample, and use each such sample to produce a confidence interval in this manner, approximately 90 of those confidence intervals would cover the true population mean difference in blood lead content levels.\n\n\n\n18.9.2 Method 2\nOr, we can apply the single-sample approach to a calculated difference in blood lead content between the exposed and control groups. Here, we’ll get a 95% two-sided confidence interval for that difference, instead of the 90% interval we obtained above.\n\ntt2 <- t.test(bloodlead$exposed - bloodlead$control, \n       conf.level = 0.95, alt = \"two.sided\")\n\ntt2\n\n\n    One Sample t-test\n\ndata:  bloodlead$exposed - bloodlead$control\nt = 5.783, df = 32, p-value = 2.036e-06\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 10.34469 21.59470\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n  15.9697 \n\ntidy(tt2) |> kable(digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nestimate\nstatistic\np.value\nparameter\nconf.low\nconf.high\nmethod\nalternative\n\n\n\n\n15.97\n5.78\n0\n32\n10.34\n21.59\nOne Sample t-test\ntwo.sided\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18.9.3 Method 3\nOr, we can provide R with two separate samples (unaffected and affected) and specify that the samples are paired. Here, we’ll get a 99% one-sided confidence interval (lower bound) for the population mean difference in blood lead content.\n\ntt3 <- t.test(bloodlead$exposed, bloodlead$control, conf.level = 0.99,\n       paired = TRUE, alt = \"greater\")\n\ntt3\n\n\n    Paired t-test\n\ndata:  bloodlead$exposed and bloodlead$control\nt = 5.783, df = 32, p-value = 1.018e-06\nalternative hypothesis: true mean difference is greater than 0\n99 percent confidence interval:\n 9.207658      Inf\nsample estimates:\nmean difference \n        15.9697 \n\ntidy(tt3) |> kable(digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nestimate\nstatistic\np.value\nparameter\nconf.low\nconf.high\nmethod\nalternative\n\n\n\n\n15.97\n5.78\n0\n32\n9.21\nInf\nPaired t-test\ngreater\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, the three different methods using t.test for paired samples will all produce identical results if we feed them the same confidence level and type of interval (two-sided, greater than or less than).\n\n\n18.9.4 Method 4\nWe can also use an intercept-only linear regression model to estimate the population mean of the paired differences with a two-tailed confidence interval, by creating a variable containing those paired differences.\n\nmodel_lead <- lm(lead_diff ~ 1, data = bloodlead)\n\ntidy(model_lead, conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n  term        estimate std.error statistic    p.value conf.low conf.high\n  <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>      <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)     16.0      2.76      5.78 0.00000204     10.3      21.6\n\n\n\n\n18.9.5 Method 5\nIf we have the data in a longer format, with a variable identifying the matched pairs, we can use a different specification for a linear model to obtain the same estimate.\n\nmodel2_lead <- lm(lead_level ~ status + factor(pair), data = bloodlead_longer)\n\ntidy(model2_lead, conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95) |>\n    filter(term == \"statusexposed\")\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n  term          estimate std.error statistic    p.value conf.low conf.high\n  <chr>            <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>      <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>\n1 statusexposed     16.0      2.76      5.78 0.00000204     10.3      21.6\n\n\n\n\n18.9.6 Assumptions\nIf we are building a confidence interval based on a sample of observations drawn from a population, then we must pay close attention to the assumptions of those procedures.

    "text": "18.14 The Sign test\nThe sign test is something we’ve skipped in our discussion so far. It is a test for consistent differences between pairs of observations, just as the paired t, Wilcoxon signed rank and bootstrap for paired samples can provide. It has the advantage that it is relatively easy to calculate by hand, and that it doesn’t require the paired differences to follow a Normal distribution. In fact, it will even work if the data are substantially skewed.\n\nCalculate the paired difference for each pair, and drop those with difference = 0.\nLet N be the number of pairs that remain, so there are 2N data points.\nLet W, the test statistic, be the number of pairs (out of N) in which the difference is positive.\nAssuming that H0 is true, then W follows a binomial distribution with probability 0.5 on N trials.\n\nFor example, consider our data on blood lead content:\n\nbloodlead$lead_diff\n\n [1] 22  5 23 -6 18 25 13 47 15 16  6  1  2  7  0  4 -9 -3 36 25  1 16 42 30 25\n[26] 23 32 17  9 -3 60 14 14\n\n\n\n\n\nDifference\n# of Pairs\n\n\n\n\nGreater than zero\n28\n\n\nEqual to zero\n1\n\n\nLess than zero\n4\n\n\n\nSo we have N = 32 pairs, with \\(W\\) = 28 that are positive. We then use the binom.test approach in R:\n\nbinom.test(x = 28, n = 32, p = 0.5, \n           alternative = \"two.sided\")\n\n\n    Exact binomial test\n\ndata:  28 and 32\nnumber of successes = 28, number of trials = 32, p-value = 1.93e-05\nalternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.5\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.7100516 0.9648693\nsample estimates:\nprobability of success \n                 0.875 \n\n\n\nA one-tailed test can be obtained by substituting in “less” or “greater” as the alternative of interest.\nThe confidence interval provided doesn’t relate back to our original population means. It’s just showing the confidence interval around the probability of the exposed mean being greater than the control mean for a pair of children."

    "section": "18.15 Paired (Dependent) vs. Independent Samples",
    "text": "18.15 Paired (Dependent) vs. Independent Samples\nOne area that consistently trips students up in this course is the thought process involved in distinguishing studies comparing means that should be analyzed using dependent (i.e. paired or matched) samples and those which should be analyzed using independent samples. A dependent samples analysis uses additional information about the sample to pair/match subjects receiving the various exposures. That additional information is not part of an independent samples analysis (unpaired testing situation.) The reasons to do this are to (a) increase statistical power, and/or (b) reduce the effect of confounding. Here are a few thoughts on the subject.\nIn the design of experiments, blocking is the term often used for the process of arranging subjects into groups (blocks) that are similar to one another. Typically, a blocking factor is a source of variability that is not of primary interest to the researcher An example of a blocking factor might be the sex of a patient; by blocking on sex, this source of variability is controlled for, thus leading to greater accuracy.\n\nIf the sample sizes are not balanced (not equal), the samples must be treated as independent, since there would be no way to precisely link all subjects. So, if we have 10 subjects receiving exposure A and 12 subjects receiving exposure B, a dependent samples analysis (such as a paired t test) is not correct.\nThe key element is a meaningful link between each observation in one exposure group and a specific observation in the other exposure group. Given a balanced design, the most common strategy indicating dependent samples involves two or more repeated measures on the same subjects. For example, if we are comparing outcomes before and after the application of an exposure, and we have, say, 20 subjects who provide us data both before and after the exposure, then the comparison of results before and after exposure should use a dependent samples analysis. The link between the subjects is the subject itself - each exposed subject serves as its own control.\nThe second most common strategy indicating dependent samples involves deliberate matching of subjects receiving the two exposures. A matched set of observations (often a pair, but it could be a trio or quartet, etc.) is determined using baseline information and then (if a pair is involved) one subject receives exposure A while the other member of the pair receives exposure B, so that by calculating the paired difference, we learn about the effect of the exposure, while controlling for the variables made similar across the two subjects by the matching process.\nIn order for a dependent samples analysis to be used, we need (a) a link between each observation across the exposure groups based on the way the data were collected, and (b) a consistent measure (with the same units of measurement) so that paired differences can be calculated and interpreted sensibly.\nIf the samples are collected to facilitate a dependent samples analysis, the correlation of the outcome measurements across the groups will often be moderately strong and positive. If that’s the case, then the use of a dependent samples analysis will reduce the effect of baseline differences between the exposure groups, and thus provide a more precise estimate. But even if the correlation is quite small, a dependent samples analysis should provide a more powerful estimate of the impact of the exposure on the outcome than would an independent samples analysis with the same number of observations.\n\n\n18.15.1 Three “Tricky” Examples\n\nSuppose we take a convenient sample of 200 patients from the population of patients who complete a blood test in April 2017 including a check of triglycerides, and who have a triglyceride level in the high category (200 to 499 mg/dl). Next, we select a patient at random from this group of 200 patients, and then identify another patient from the group of 200 who is the same age (to within 2 years) and also the same sex. We then randomly assign our intervention to one of these two patients and usual care without our intervention to the other patient. We then set these two patients aside and return to our original sample, repeating the process until we cannot find any more patients in the same age range and of the same gender. This generates a total of 77 patients who receive the intervention and 77 who do not. If we are trying to assess the effect of our intervention on triglyceride level in October 2017 using this sample of 154 people, should we use dependent (paired) or independent samples?\nSuppose we take a convenient sample of 77 patients from the population of patients who complete a blood test in April 2017 including a check of triglycerides, and who have a triglyceride level in the high category (200 to 499 mg/dl). Next, we take a convenient sample of 77 patients from the population of patients who complete a blood test in May 2017 including a check of triglycerides, and who have a triglyceride level in the high category (200 to 499 mg/dl). We flip a coin to determine whether the intervention will be given to each of the 77 patients from April 2017 (if the coin comes up “HEADS”) or instead to each of the 77 patients from May 2017 (if the coin comes up “TAILS”). Then, we assign our intervention to the patients seen in the month specified by the coin and assign usual care without our intervention to the patients seen in the other month. If we are trying to assess the effect of our intervention on triglyceride level in October 2017 using this sample of 154 people, should we use dependent (paired) or independent samples?\nSuppose we take a convenient sample of 200 patients from the population of patients who complete a blood test in April 2017 including a check of triglycerides, and who have a triglyceride level in the high category (200 to 499 mg/dl). For each patient, we re-measure them again in October 2017, again checking their triglyceride level. But in between, we take the first 77 of the patients in a randomly sorted list and assign them to our intervention (which takes place from June through September 2017) and take an additional group of 77 patients from the remaining part of the list and assign them to usual care without our intervention over the same time period. If we are trying to assess the effect of our intervention on each individual’s change in triglyceride level (from April/May to October) using this sample of 154 people, should we use dependent (paired) or independent samples?\n\nAnswers to these “tricky” examples appear at the end of this Chapter."

Our first task is to identify the outcome and the exposure groups. Here, we are comparing the distribution of our outcome (triglyceride level in October) across two exposures: (a) receiving the intervention and (b) not receiving the intervention. We have a sample of 77 patients receiving the intervention, and a different sample of 77 patients receiving usual care. Each of the 77 subjects receiving the intervention is matched (on age and sex) to a specific subject not receiving the intervention. So, we can calculate paired differences by taking the triglyceride level for the exposed member of each pair and subtracting the triglyceride level for the usual care member of that same pair. Thus our comparison of the exposure groups should be accomplished using a dependent samples analysis, such as a paired t test.\nAnswer for 2. Again, we begin by identifying the outcome (triglyceride level in October) and the exposure groups. Here, we compare two exposures: (a) receiving the intervention and (b) receiving usual care. We have a sample of 77 patients receiving the intervention, and a different sample of 77 patients receiving usual care. But there is no pairing or matching involved. There is no connection implied by the way that the data were collected that implies that, for example, patient 1 in the intervention group is linked to any particular subject in the usual care group. So we need to analyze the data using independent samples.\nAnswer for 3. Once again, we identify the outcome (now it is the within-subject change in triglyceride level from April to October) and the exposure groups. Here again, we compare two exposures: (a) receiving the intervention and (b) receiving usual care. We have a sample of 77 patients receiving the intervention, and a different sample of 77 patients receiving usual care. But again, there is no pairing or matching between the patients receiving the intervention and the patients receiving usual care. While each outcome value is a difference (or change) in triglyceride levels, there’s no connection implied by the way that the data were collected that implies that, for example, patient 1 in the intervention group is linked to any particular subject in the usual care group. So, again, we need to analyze the data using independent samples.\nFor more background and fundamental material, you might consider the Wikipedia pages on Paired Difference Test and on Blocking (statistics).\n\n\n\n\nBock, David E., Paul F.

We can, in many settings, use confidence intervals to summarize the results, as well, and confidence intervals and hypothesis tests are closely connected.\nIn particular, it’s worth stressing that:\n\nA significant effect is not necessarily the same thing as an interesting effect. For example, results calculated from large samples are nearly always “significant” even when the effects are quite small in magnitude. Before doing a test, always ask if the effect is large enough to be of any practical interest. If not, why do the test?\nA non-significant effect is not necessarily the same thing as no difference. A large effect of real practical interest may still produce a non-significant result simply because the sample is too small.\nThere are assumptions behind all statistical inferences. Checking assumptions is crucial to validating the inference made by any test or confidence interval."

    "text": "19.8 The ASA Articles in 2016 and 2019 on Statistical Significance and P-Values\nHowever, my primary motivation for taking the approach I’m taking comes from the pieces in two key reference collections we’ll read and discuss more thoroughly in 431 and 432.\n\nThe American Statistical Association’s 2016 Statement on p-Values: Context, Process and Purpose.\n\n\nThe ASA Statement on p-Values and Statistical Significance (Wasserstein and Lazar 2016) was developed primarily because after decades, warnings about the don’ts had gone mostly unheeded. The statement was about what not to do, because there is widespread agreement about the don’ts.\n\n\nStatistical Inference in the 21st Century: A World Beyond p < 0.05 from 2019 in The American Statistician\n\n\nThis is a world where researchers are free to treat “p = 0.051” and “p = 0.049” as not being categorically different, where authors no longer find themselves constrained to selectively publish their results based on a single magic number. In this world, where studies with “p < 0.05” and studies with “p > 0.05” are not automatically in conflict, researchers will see their results more easily replicated-and, even when not, they will better understand why. As we venture down this path, we will begin to see fewer false alarms, fewer overlooked discoveries, and the development of more customized statistical strategies. Researchers will be free to communicate all their findings in all their glorious uncertainty, knowing their work is to be judged by the quality and effective communication of their science, and not by their p-values. As “statistical significance” is used less, statistical thinking will be used more. The ASA Statement on P-Values and Statistical Significance started moving us toward this world…. Now we must go further.\n\n\nThe ASA Statement on P-Values and Statistical Significance stopped just short of recommending that declarations of “statistical significance” be abandoned. We take that step here. We conclude, based on our review of the articles in this special issue and the broader literature, that it is time to stop using the term “statistically significant” entirely. Nor should variants such as “significantly different,” “p < 0.05,” and “nonsignificant” survive, whether expressed in words, by asterisks in a table, or in some other way…. Regardless of whether it was ever useful, a declaration of “statistical significance” has today become meaningless.\n\nFor the moment, I will say this. I emphasize confidence intervals over p values, which is at best a partial solution. But …\n\nVery rarely does a situation emerge in which a p value can be available in which looking at the associated confidence interval isn’t far more helpful for making a comparison of interest.\nThe use of a p value requires making at least as many assumptions about the population, sample, individuals and data as does a confidence interval.\nMost null hypotheses are clearly not exactly true prior to data collection, and so the test summarized by a p value is of questionable value most of the time.\nNo one has a truly adequate definition of a p value, in terms of both precision and parsimony. Brief, understandable definitions always fail to be technically accurate.\nBayesian approaches avoid some of these pitfalls, but come with their own issues.\nMany smart people agree with me, and have sworn off of p values whenever they can.\n\nAgain, we’ll look at these issues in greater depth later in the course."

A false negative in a screening test for cancer could lead to a fatal delay in treatment, whereas a false positive would probably lead to a retest. A more troublesome example occurs in testing for an infectious disease. Inevitably, there is a trade-off between the two types of errors. It all depends on the consequences.\nIt would be nice if we could specify the probability that we were making an error with each potential decision. We could then weigh the consequence of the error against its probability. Unfortunately, in most cases, we can only specify the conditional probability of making a Type I error, given that the null hypothesis is true.\nIn deciding whether to reject a null hypothesis, we will need to consider the consequences of the two potential types of errors. If a Type I error is very serious, then you should reject the null hypothesis only if the p value is very small. Conversely, if a Type II error is more serious, you should be willing to reject the null hypothesis with a larger p value, perhaps 0.10 or 0.20, instead of 0.05.\n\n\\(\\alpha\\) is the probability of rejecting \\(H_0\\) when \\(H_0\\) is true.\n\nSo 1 - \\(\\alpha\\), the confidence level, is the probability of retaining \\(H_0\\) when that’s the right thing to do.\n\n\\(\\beta\\) is the probability of retaining \\(H_0\\) when \\(H_A\\) is true.\n\nSo 1 - \\(\\beta\\), the power, is the probability of rejecting \\(H_0\\) when that’s the right thing to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n–\n\\(H_A\\) is True\n\\(H_0\\) is True\n\n\n\n\nTest Rejects \\(H_0\\)\nCorrect Decision (1 - \\(\\beta\\))\nType I Error (\\(\\alpha\\))\n\n\nTest Retains \\(H_0\\)\nType II Error (\\(\\beta\\))\nCorrect Decision (1 - \\(\\alpha\\))"

    "text": "19.14 Power and Sample Size Considerations\nFor most statistical tests, it is theoretically possible to estimate the power of the test in the design stage, (before any data are collected) for various sample sizes, so we can hone in on a sample size choice which will enable us to collect data only on as many subjects as are truly necessary.\nA power calculation is likely the most common element of an scientific grant proposal on which a statistician is consulted. This is a fine idea in theory, but in practice…\n\nThe tests that have power calculations worked out in intensive detail using R are mostly those with more substantial assumptions. Examples include t tests that assume population normality, common population variance and balanced designs in the independent samples setting, or paired t tests that assume population normality in the paired samples setting.\nThese power calculations are also usually based on tests rather than confidence intervals, which would be much more useful in most settings. Simulation is your friend here.\nEven more unfortunately, this process of doing power and related calculations is far more of an art than a science.\nAs a result, the value of many power calculations is negligible, since the assumptions being made are so arbitrary and poorly connected to real data.\nOn several occasions, I have stood in front of a large audience of medical statisticians actively engaged in clinical trials and other studies that require power calculations for funding. When I ask for a show of hands of people who have had power calculations prior to such a study whose assumptions matched the eventual data perfectly, I get lots of laughs. It doesn’t happen.\nEven the underlying framework that assumes a power of 80% with a significance level of 5% is sufficient for most studies is pretty silly.\n\nAll that said, I feel obliged to show you some examples of power calculations done using R, and provide some insight on how to make some of the key assumptions in a way that won’t alert reviewers too much to the silliness of the enterprise. All of the situations described in this Chapter are toy problems, but they may be instructive about some fundamental ideas."

Suppose you are planning a new study to see if beef consumption levels have changed. You plan to take a random sample of 25 people to build your new estimate, and test whether the current pounds of beef consumed per year is 90. Suppose you want to do a two-sided (two-tailed) test at 95% confidence (so \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05), and that you expect that the true difference will need to be at least \\(\\delta\\) = 5 pounds (i.e. 85 or less or 95 or more) in order for the result to be of any real, practical interest. Suppose also that you are willing to assume that the true standard deviation of the measurements in the population is 10 pounds.\nThat is, of course, a lot to suppose.\nNow, we want to know what power the proposed experiment will have to detect a change of 5 pounds (or more) away from the original 90 pounds, with these specifications, and how tweaking these specifications will affect the power of the study.\nSo, we have - n = 25 data points to be collected - \\(\\delta\\) = 5 pounds is the minimum clinically meaningful effect size - s = 10 is the assumed population standard deviation, in pounds per year - \\(\\alpha\\) is 0.05, and we’ll do a two-sided test\n\n\n19.15.2 Using the power.t.test function\n\npower.t.test(n = 25, delta = 5, sd = 10, sig.level = 0.05, \n             type=\"one.sample\", alternative=\"two.sided\")\n\n\n     One-sample t test power calculation \n\n              n = 25\n          delta = 5\n             sd = 10\n      sig.level = 0.05\n          power = 0.6697014\n    alternative = two.sided\n\n\nSo, under this study design, we would expect to detect an effect of size \\(\\delta\\) = 5 pounds with just under 67% power, i.e. with a probability of incorrect retention of \\(H_0\\) of just about 1/3. Most of the time, we’d like to improve this power, and to do so, we’d need to adjust our assumptions."

    "text": "19.16 Changing Assumptions\nWe made assumptions about the sample size n, the minimum clinically meaningful effect size (change in the population mean) \\(\\delta\\), the population standard deviation s, and the significance level \\(\\alpha\\), not to mention decisions about the test, like that we’d do a one-sample t test, rather than another sort of test for a single sample, and that we’d do a two-tailed, or two-sided test. Often, these assumptions are tweaked a bit to make the power look more like what a reviewer/funder is hoping to see.\n\n19.16.1 Increasing Sample Size Increases Power\nSuppose, we committed to using more resources and gathering data from 40 subjects instead of the 25 we assumed initially – what effect would this have on our power?\n\npower.t.test(n = 40, delta = 5, sd = 10, sig.level = 0.05, \n             type=\"one.sample\", alternative=\"two.sided\")\n\n\n     One-sample t test power calculation \n\n              n = 40\n          delta = 5\n             sd = 10\n      sig.level = 0.05\n          power = 0.8693979\n    alternative = two.sided\n\n\nWith more samples, we should have a more powerful test, able to detect the difference with greater probability. In fact, a sample of 40 paired differences yields 87% power. As it turns out, we would need at least 44 observations with this scenario to get to 90% power, as shown in the calculation below, which puts the power in, but leaves out the sample size.\n\npower.t.test(power=0.9, delta = 5, sd = 10, sig.level = 0.05, \n             type=\"one.sample\", alternative=\"two.sided\")\n\n\n     One-sample t test power calculation \n\n              n = 43.99552\n          delta = 5\n             sd = 10\n      sig.level = 0.05\n          power = 0.9\n    alternative = two.sided\n\n\nWe see that we would need at least 44 observations to achieve 90% power. Note: we always round the sample size up in doing a power calculation – if this calculation had actually suggested n = 43.1 paired differences were needed, we would still have rounded up to 44.\n\n\n19.16.2 Increasing Effect Size will increase Power\nA larger effect should be easier to detect. If we go back to our original calculation, which had 67% power to detect an effect of size \\(\\delta\\) = 5, and now change the desired effect size to \\(\\delta\\) = 6 pounds (i.e. a value of 84 or less or 96 or more), we should obtain a more powerful design.\n\npower.t.test(n = 25, delta = 6, sd = 10, sig.level = 0.05, \n             type=\"one.sample\", alternative=\"two.sided\")\n\n\n     One-sample t test power calculation \n\n              n = 25\n          delta = 6\n             sd = 10\n      sig.level = 0.05\n          power = 0.8207213\n    alternative = two.sided\n\n\nWe see that this change in effect size from 5 to 6, leaving everything else the same, increases our power from 67% to 82%. To reach 90% power, we’d need to increase the effect size we were trying to detect to at least 6.76 pounds.\n\npower.t.test(n = 25, power = 0.9, sd = 10, sig.level = 0.05, \n             type=\"one.sample\", alternative=\"two.sided\")\n\n\n     One-sample t test power calculation \n\n              n = 25\n          delta = 6.759051\n             sd = 10\n      sig.level = 0.05\n          power = 0.9\n    alternative = two.sided\n\n\n\nAgain, note that I am rounding up here.\nUsing \\(\\delta\\) = 6.75 would not quite make it to 90.00% power.\nUsing \\(\\delta\\) = 6.76 guarantees that the power will be 90% or more, and not just round up to 90%.\n\n\n\n19.16.3 Decreasing the Standard Deviation will increase Power\nThe choice of standard deviation is usually motivated by a pilot study, or else pulled out of thin air - it’s relatively easy to convince yourself that the true standard deviation might be a little smaller than you’d guessed initially. Let’s see what happens to the power if we reduce the sample standard deviation from 10 pounds to 9. This should make the effect of 5 pounds easier to detect, because it will have smaller variation associated with it.\n\npower.t.test(n = 25, delta = 5, sd = 9, sig.level = 0.05, \n             type=\"one.sample\", alternative=\"two.sided\")\n\n\n     One-sample t test power calculation \n\n              n = 25\n          delta = 5\n             sd = 9\n      sig.level = 0.05\n          power = 0.759672\n    alternative = two.sided\n\n\nThis change in standard deviation from 10 to 9, leaving everything else the same, increases our power from 67% to nearly 76%. To reach 90% power, we’d need to decrease the standard deviation of the population paired differences to no more than 7.39 pounds.\n\npower.t.test(n = 25, delta = 5, sd = NULL, power = 0.9, sig.level = 0.05, \n             type=\"one.sample\", alternative=\"two.sided\")\n\n\n     One-sample t test power calculation \n\n              n = 25\n          delta = 5\n             sd = 7.397486\n      sig.level = 0.05\n          power = 0.9\n    alternative = two.sided\n\n\nNote I am rounding down here.\n\nUsing s = 7.4 pounds would not quite make it to 90.00% power.\n\nNote also that in order to get R to treat the standard debviation as unknown, I must specify it as NULL in the formula.\n\n\n19.16.4 Larger Significance Level increases Power\nWe can trade off some of our Type II error (lack of power) for Type I error. If we are willing to trade off some Type I error (as described by the \\(\\alpha\\)), we can improve the power. For instance, suppose we decided to run the original test with 90% confidence.\n\npower.t.test(n = 25, delta = 5, sd = 10, sig.level = 0.1, \n             type=\"one.sample\", alternative=\"two.sided\")\n\n\n     One-sample t test power calculation \n\n              n = 25\n          delta = 5\n             sd = 10\n      sig.level = 0.1\n          power = 0.7833861\n    alternative = two.sided\n\n\nThe calculation suggests that our power would thus increase from 67% to just over 78%."

    "text": "19.19 A New Example\nSuppose we plan a study of the time to relapse for patients in a drug trial, where subjects will be assigned randomly to a (new) treatment or to a placebo. Suppose we anticipate that the placebo group will have a mean of about 9 months, and want to detect an improvement (increase) in time to relapse of 50%, so that the treatment group would have a mean of at least 13.5 months. We’ll use \\(\\alpha\\) = .10 and \\(\\beta\\) = .10, as well. Assume we’d do a two-sided test, with an equal number of observations in each group, and we’ll assume the observed standard deviation of 9 months in a pilot study will hold here, as well.\nWe want the sample size required by the test under a two sample setting where:\n\n\\(\\alpha\\) = .10,\nwith 90% power (so that \\(\\beta\\) = .10),\nand where we will have equal numbers of samples in the placebo group (group 1) and the treatment group (group 2).\n\nWe’ll plug in the observed standard deviation of 9 months.\nWe’ll look at detecting a change from 9 [the average in the placebo group] to 13.5 (a difference of 50%, giving delta = 4.5)\nusing a two-sided pooled t-test.\n\nThe appropriate R command is:\n\npower.t.test(delta = 4.5, sd = 9, \n             sig.level = 0.10, power = 0.9, \n             type=\"two.sample\", \n             alternative=\"two.sided\")\n\n\n     Two-sample t test power calculation \n\n              n = 69.19782\n          delta = 4.5\n             sd = 9\n      sig.level = 0.1\n          power = 0.9\n    alternative = two.sided\n\nNOTE: n is number in *each* group\n\n\nThis suggests that we will need a sample of at least 70 subjects in the treated group and an additional 70 subjects in the placebo group, for a total of 140 subjects.\n\n19.19.1 Another Scenario\nWhat if resources are sparse, and we’ll be forced to do the study with no more than 120 subjects, overall?

What sample size would be required to maintain 90% power? There is one change here – the effect size d in the pwr.t2n.test command is specified using the difference in means \\(\\delta\\) that we used previously, divided by the standard deviation s that we used previously. So, in our old setup, we assumed delta = 4.5, sd = 9, so now we’ll assume d = 4.5/9 instead.\n\npwr.t2n.test(n1 = 100, d = 4.5/9, \n             sig.level = 0.1, power = 0.9,\n             alternative=\"two.sided\")\n\n\n     t test power calculation \n\n             n1 = 100\n             n2 = 52.82433\n              d = 0.5\n      sig.level = 0.1\n          power = 0.9\n    alternative = two.sided\n\n\nWe would need at least 53 subjects in the “placebo” group.\n\n19.20.1 The most efficient design for an independent samples comparison will be balanced.\n\nNote that if we use \\(n_1\\) = 100 subjects in the treated group, we need at least \\(n_2\\) = 53 in the placebo group to achieve 90% power, and a total of 153 subjects.\nCompare this to the balanced design, where we needed 70 subjects in each group to achieve the same power, thus, a total of 140 subjects.\n\nWe saw earlier that a test with 60 subjects in each group would yield just under 86% power.

    "text": "20.2 A Study of Battery Life\nShould you buy generic rather than brand-name batteries? Bock, Velleman, and De Veaux (2004) descibe a designed experiment to test battery life. A (male) student obtained six pairs of AA alkaline batteries from two major battery manufacturers; a well-known brand name and a generic brand, so that battery brand was the factor of interest.\nTo estimate the difference in mean lifetimes across the two manufacturers, the student kept a battery-powered CD player with the same CD running continuously, with the volume control fixed at 5, and measured the time until no more music was heard through the headphones. (He ran an initial trial to find out approximately how long that would take, so he didn’t have to spend the first 3 hours of each run listening to the same CD.) The outcome was the time in minutes until the sound stopped. To account for changes in the CD player’s performance over time, he randomized the run order by choosing pairs of batteries (the CD-player required two batteries to run) at random.\nHere are the results for the 6 brand name and 6 generic tests, in minutes, found in the battery.csv data file, where run indicates the order in which the tests were run…\n\nbattery <- read_csv(\"data/battery.csv\",\n                    show_col_types = FALSE)\n\nbattery\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 4\n     run  test type        time\n   <dbl> <dbl> <chr>      <dbl>\n 1     1     1 brand name  191.\n 2     2     2 brand name  206.\n 3     6     3 brand name  199.\n 4     8     4 brand name  172.\n 5     9     5 brand name  184 \n 6    12     6 brand name  170.\n 7     3     1 generic     194 \n 8     4     2 generic     204.\n 9     5     3 generic     204.\n10     7     4 generic     206.\n11    10     5 generic     222.\n12    11     6 generic     209.\n\n\n\n20.2.1 Question 1. What is the outcome under study?\nWe are studying battery lifetimes (time until the sound stopped) in minutes.\n\n\n20.2.2 Question 2. What are the treatment/exposure groups?\nWe are comparing the two brands of batteries: the well-known vs. the generic.\n\n\n20.2.3 Question 3. Are the data collected using paired or independent samples?\nOf course, if we had different numbers of samples in the two groups, then we’d know without further thought that independent samples were required. Since we have 6 observations in the brand name group, and also have 6 observations in the generic group, i.e. a balanced design, we need to pause now to decide whether paired or independent samples testing is appropriate in this setting.\nTwo samples are paired if each data point in one sample is naturally linked to a specific data point in the other sample. So, do we have paired or independent samples?\n\nDespite the way I’ve set up the data table, there is no particular reason to pair, say, run #1 (a brand name run) with any particular experimental run in the generic group. So the samples are independent. This is not a matched-pairs design.\nIn each trial, the student either used two of the well-known batteries, or two of the generic batteries.\nAny of the tests/confidence intervals for the independent samples methods suggests a statistically significant (at the 5% level) difference between the generic and brand name batteries.\n\n\n\n20.2.4 Question 4. Are the data a random sample from the population of interest?\nProbably not. The data are likely to come from a convenient sample of batteries. I don’t know how this might bias the study, though. It seems unlikely that there would be a particular bias unless, for example, the well-known batteries were substantially older or younger than the generic.\n\n\n20.2.5 Question 5. What significance level will we use?\nWe have no reason not to use a 95% confidence level.\n\n\n20.2.6 Question 6. Are we using a one-sided or two-sided comparison?\nWe could argue for a one-sided comparison, but I’ll be safe and use the two-sided version.\n\n\n20.2.7 Question 9. What does the distribution of outcomes in each group tell us?\n\nggplot(battery, aes(x = type, y = time, fill = type)) +\n  geom_jitter(aes(color = type), alpha = 0.75, width = 0.125) +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  guides(fill = \"none\", col = \"none\") +\n  labs(title = \"Battery Running Time, by Manufacturer\",\n       y = \"Running Time (minutes)\", x = \"Manufacturer\")\n\n\n\n\nWe can generate histograms, too, but that’s an issue, because we have so few observations.\n\nggplot(battery, aes(x = time, fill = type)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 6, col = \"white\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ type) +\n  guides(fill = \"none\") + \n  labs(title = \"Battery Running Time, by Manufacturer\")\n\n\n\n\n\nmosaic::favstats(time ~ type, data = battery)\n\nRegistered S3 method overwritten by 'mosaic':\n  method                           from   \n  fortify.SpatialPolygonsDataFrame ggplot2\n\n\n        type   min    Q1 median      Q3   max     mean        sd n missing\n1 brand name 169.5 175.3 187.35 197.075 205.5 186.8833 14.374341 6       0\n2    generic 194.0 203.5 205.00 208.675 222.5 206.5667  9.366251 6       0\n\n\nIt sure looks like the generic batteries lasted longer. And they also look like they were more consistent. The sample means are 206.6 for the generic group, 186.9 minutes for brand name, so the point estimate of the difference is 19.7 minutes.\nThe question is: can we be confident that the difference we observe here is more than just random fluctuation, at a 5% significance level?\n\n\n20.2.8 Inferential Results for the Battery Study\nIn the table below, I have summarized the two-sided testing results for most of the ways in which we have looked at a two sample comparison so far, with 95% confidence intervals. If the samples really are paired, then we must choose from the paired samples comparisons described in the table.

    "text": "20.3 The Breakfast Study: Does Oat Bran Cereal Lower Serum LDL Cholesterol?\nNorman and Streiner (2014) describe a crossover study that was conducted to investigate whether oat bran cereal helps to lower serum cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolemic males. Fourteen such individuals were randomly placed on a diet that included either oat bran or corn flakes; after two weeks, their low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, in mmol/l were recorded. Each subject was then switched to the alternative diet. After a second two-week period, the LDL cholesterol level of each subject was again recorded.\n\nbreakfast <- read_csv(\"data/breakfast.csv\",\n                    show_col_types = FALSE)\n\nbreakfast\n\n# A tibble: 14 × 3\n   subject cornflakes oatbran\n     <dbl>      <dbl>   <dbl>\n 1       1       4.61    3.84\n 2       2       6.42    5.57\n 3       3       5.4     5.85\n 4       4       4.54    4.8 \n 5       5       3.98    3.68\n 6       6       3.82    2.96\n 7       7       5.01    4.41\n 8       8       4.34    3.72\n 9       9       3.8     3.49\n10      10       4.56    3.84\n11      11       5.35    5.26\n12      12       3.89    3.73\n13      13       2.25    1.84\n14      14       4.24    4.14\n\n\n\n20.3.1 Question 1. What is the outcome under study?\nWe are studying levels of LDL cholesterol, in mmol/l. Note that if we wanted to convert to a more familiar scale, specifically mg/dl, we would multiply the mmol/l by 18, as it turns out.\n\n\n20.3.2 Question 2. What are the treatment/exposure groups?\nWe are comparing subjects after two weeks of eating corn flakes to the same subjects after two weeks of eating oat bran.\n\n\n20.3.3 Question 3.

The data are likely to come from a convenient sample of 14 individuals but they were randomly assigned to cornflakes first or to oat bran first, then crossed over.\n\n\n20.3.5 Question 5.

    "text": "20.4 Power, Sample Size and the Breakfast Study\nAs a preview of what’s next to come, let’s investigate these promising results a bit further. Suppose that in a new study, you wish to be able to detect a difference in LDL cholesterol between two exposures: subjects who eat cornflakes (as in the original study) and subjects who continue to eat cornflakes but also take a supplemental dosage of what you believe to be the crucial ingredient in oatbran.\nSuppose you believe that the effect of taking the new supplement will be about half the size of the effect you observed in the original breakfast study on hypercholesterolemic males, but that males generally may be more likely to take your supplement regularly than switch from cornflakes to a less appetizing breakfast choice, making your supplement attractive.\nWhat sample size will be required to yield 90% power to detect an effect half the size of the effect we observed in the breakfast study, in a new paired samples study using a two-tailed 5% significance level? What if we only required 80% power?\n\n20.4.1 The Setup\nWe want to know n, the minimum required sample size for the new study, and we have:\n\nA specified effect size of half of what we saw in the breakfast study, where the sample mean difference between cornflakes and oatbran was 0.36 mmol/l, so our effect size is assumed to be delta = 0.18 mmol/l.\nAn assumed standard deviation equal to the standard deviation of the differences in the pilot breakfast study, which turns out to have been s = 0.41 mmol/l.\nWe also have a pre-specified alpha = 0.05 using a two-tailed test.\nWe also want the power to be at least 90% for our new study.\n\n\n\n20.4.2 The R Calculations\nQuestion 1. What sample size will be required to yield 90% power to detect an effect half the size of the effect we observed in the breakfast study, in a new paired samples study using a two-tailed 5% significance level?\n\npower.t.test(delta = 0.18, sd = 0.41, sig.level = 0.05, \n             power = 0.9, type=\"paired\", alternative=\"two.sided\")\n\n\n     Paired t test power calculation \n\n              n = 56.47119\n          delta = 0.18\n             sd = 0.41\n      sig.level = 0.05\n          power = 0.9\n    alternative = two.sided\n\nNOTE: n is number of *pairs*, sd is std.dev. of *differences* within pairs\n\n\nAnd so our new study will require at least 57 subjects (each measured in two circumstances, so 114 total measurements) in order to achieve at least 90% power to detect the difference of 0.18 mmol/l while meeting these specifications.\nQuestion 2. What if we were willing to accept only 80% power?\n\npower.t.test(delta = 0.18, sd = 0.41, sig.level = 0.05, \n             power = 0.8, type=\"paired\", alternative=\"two.sided\")\n\n\n     Paired t test power calculation \n\n              n = 42.68269\n          delta = 0.18\n             sd = 0.41\n      sig.level = 0.05\n          power = 0.8\n    alternative = two.sided\n\nNOTE: n is number of *pairs*, sd is std.dev. of *differences* within pairs\n\n\nIt turns out that this would require at least 43 subjects.\n\n\n20.4.3 Independent samples, instead of paired samples?\nWhat would happen if, instead of doing a paired samples study, we did one using independent samples? Assuming we used a balanced design, and assigned the same number of different people at random to either the oatbran supplement or regular cornflakes alone, we could do such a study, but it would require many more people to obtain similar power to the paired samples study.\n\npower.t.test(delta = 0.18, sd = 0.41, sig.level = 0.05, \n             power = 0.9, type=\"two.sample\", alternative=\"two.sided\")\n\n\n     Two-sample t test power calculation \n\n              n = 110\n          delta = 0.18\n             sd = 0.41\n      sig.level = 0.05\n          power = 0.9\n    alternative = two.sided\n\nNOTE: n is number in *each* group\n\n\nIn all, 220 people would be required in the independent samples study (110 in each exposure group), as compared to only 57 people (each measured twice) in the paired study.\n\n\n\n\nBock, David E., Paul F.

    "text": "21.2 A First Example: Serum Zinc in the “Normal” Range?\nRecall that in the serum zinc study, we have 462 teenage male subjects, of whom 395 (or 85.5%) fell in the “normal range” of 66 to 110 micrograms per deciliter.\n\nserzinc <- read_csv(\"data/serzinc.csv\", \n                    show_col_types = FALSE)\n\nserzinc <- serzinc |> \n  mutate(in_range = ifelse(zinc >= 66 & zinc <= 110, 1, 0))\n\nserzinc |> tabyl(in_range) |> \n  adorn_totals() |> adorn_pct_formatting()\n\n in_range   n percent\n        0  67   14.5%\n        1 395   85.5%\n    Total 462  100.0%\n\n\nPreviously, we estimated a confidence interval for the mean of the population zinc levels. Now, we want to estimate a confidence interval for the proportion of the population whose serum zinc levels are in the range of 66 to 110. We want to build both a point estimate for the population proportion, and a confidence interval for the population proportion.\nNow, let’s identify a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of the population whose zinc levels are within the “normal” range. We have seen that 395 / 462 subjects (or a proportion of 0.855) fall in the “normal range” in our sample. For now, that will also be our point estimate of the proportion in the “normal range” across the entire population of teenagers like those in our sample.\n\nserzinc <- serzinc |>\n    mutate(in_range = ifelse(zinc > 65 & zinc < 111, 1, 0))\n\nserzinc |> tabyl(in_range)\n\n in_range   n   percent\n        0  67 0.1450216\n        1 395 0.8549784\n\n\nOnce we’ve created this 0-1 variable, there are several available approaches for wrapping a confidence interval around this proportion.\n\n21.2.1 Using an Intercept-Only Regression Again?\nWe might consider taking the same approach as we did with the population mean earlier:\n\nmodel_zincprop <- lm(in_range ~ 1, data = serzinc)\n\ntidy(model_zincprop, conf.int = TRUE, conf = 0.90) |> \n    knitr::kable(digits = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\nconf.low\nconf.high\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n0.855\n0.016\n52.133\n0\n0.828\n0.882\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there are more powerful approaches to estimate a confidence interval around this proportion, this simple approach turns out not to be too bad, so long as the sample proportion isn’t very close to either 0 or 1.\n\n\n21.2.2 A 100(1-\\(\\alpha\\))% Confidence Interval for a Population Proportion\nSuppose we want to estimate a confidence interval for an unknown population proportion, \\(\\pi\\), on the basis of a random sample of n observations from that population which yields a sample proportion of p. Note that this p is the sample proportion – it’s not a p value.\n\nIn our serum zinc example, we have n = 462 observations, with a sample proportion (“in range”) of p = 0.855.\n\nA 100(1-\\(\\alpha\\))% confidence interval for the population proportion \\(\\pi\\) can be created by using the standard normal distribution, the sample proportion, p, and the standard error of a sample proportion, which is defined as the square root of p multiplied by (1-p) divided by the sample size, n. \n\nSo the standard error is estimated in our serum zinc example as:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{p (1-p)}{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.855(1-0.855)}{462}} = \\sqrt{0.000268} = 0.016\n\\]\nAnd thus, our confidence interval is \\(p \\pm Z_{\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\\)\nwhere \\(Z_{\\alpha/2}\\) = the value from a standard Normal distribution cutting off the top \\(\\alpha/2\\) of the distribution, obtained in R by substituting the desired \\(\\alpha/2\\) value into the following command: qnorm(alpha/2, lower.tail=FALSE).\nNote: This interval is reasonably accurate so long as np and n(1-p) are each at least 5.\n\nFor the serum zinc data, we have np = (462)(0.855) = 395 and n(1-p) = 462(1 - 0.855) = 67, so this should be ok.\nFor \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05, we have \\(Z_{\\alpha/2}\\) = 1.96, approximately.\n\n\nqnorm(0.025, lower.tail = FALSE)\n\n[1] 1.959964\n\n\n\nThus, for the serum zinc estimate, this confidence interval would be:\n\n\\[\np \\pm Z_{\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} =\n\\frac{395}{462} \\pm 1.96 \\sqrt{\\frac{0.855(1-0.855)}{462}} = 0.855 \\pm 0.032\n\\]\nor (0.823, 0.887)."

    "text": "21.3 Using binom.test from the mosaic package\nI am aware of at least seven different procedures for estimating a confidence interval for a population proportion using R. All have minor weaknesses: none is importantly different from the others in many practical situations. Five of these methods are available using the binom.test function from the mosaic package in R.\nThe general format for using the binom.test function is as follows:\nmosaic::binom.test(x = 395,  # substitute in number of successes\n                   n = 462,  # substitute in number of trials\n                   conf.level = 0.95, # default confidence level\n                   p = 0.5,  # default null hypothesis proportion\n                   ci.method = \"XXX\") # see below for XXX options\nwhere the appropriate ci.method is obtained from the table below.\n\n\n\nApproach\nci.method to be used\n\n\n\n\nWald\n“Wald”\n\n\nClopper-Pearson\n“Clopper-Pearson” or “binom.test”\n\n\nScore\n“Score” or “prop.test”\n\n\nAgresti-Coull\n“agresti-coull”\n\n\nPlus4\n“plus4”\n\n\n\n\n21.3.1 The Wald test approach\nThe Wald approach can be used to establish a very similar confidence interval to the one we calculated above, based on something called the Wald test.\nHere, we specify the x and n values. n is the total number of observations, and x is the number where the event of interest (in this case, serum zinc levels in the normal range) occurs. So x = 395 and n = 462.\n\nm_wald <- mosaic::binom.test(x = 395, n = 462,\n                     conf.level = 0.95,\n                     ci.method = \"Wald\")\n\nRegistered S3 method overwritten by 'mosaic':\n  method                           from   \n  fortify.SpatialPolygonsDataFrame ggplot2\n\nm_wald\n\n\n    Exact binomial test (Wald CI)\n\ndata:  395 out of 462\nnumber of successes = 395, number of trials = 462, p-value < 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.5\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.8228698 0.8870869\nsample estimates:\nprobability of success \n             0.8549784 \n\n\nThe Wald confidence interval is always symmetric around our point estimate, and can dip below 0 or above 1.\nWhen I fit intervals using the approaches in mosaic::binom_test() I will usually tidy them.\n\ntidy(m_wald) |> \n  select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high, statistic, parameter) |>\n  kable(digits = 3)\n\n\n\n\nestimate\nconf.low\nconf.high\nstatistic\nparameter\n\n\n\n\n0.855\n0.823\n0.887\n395\n462\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other elements of the tidied result are shown below.\n\ntidy(m_wald) |>\n  select(method, alternative, p.value)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  method                        alternative  p.value\n  <chr>                         <chr>          <dbl>\n1 Exact binomial test (Wald CI) two.sided   1.23e-57\n\n\n\n\n21.3.2 The Clopper-Pearson approach\nThe binom.test command can be used to establish an “exact” confidence interval. This uses the method of Clopper and Pearson from 1934, and is exact in the sense that it guarantees, for instance, that the confidence level associated with the interval is at least as large as the nominal level of 95%, but not that the interval isn’t wider than perhaps it needs to be.\n\nm_clopper <- mosaic::binom.test(x = 395, n = 462,\n                                conf.level = 0.95,\n                                ci.method = \"Clopper-Pearson\")\n\nm_clopper\n\n\n\n\ndata:  395 out of 462\nnumber of successes = 395, number of trials = 462, p-value < 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.5\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.8195187 0.8858100\nsample estimates:\nprobability of success \n             0.8549784 \n\n\nClopper-Pearson is used by stats::binom.test() in R as well. Again, it guarantees coverage at least as large as the nominal coverage rate, but may produce wider intervals than the other methods we’ll see. The 95% confidence interval by this method is (0.820, 0.886), which is in the same general range as our previous estimates.\n\ntidy(m_clopper) |> \n  select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high, statistic, parameter) |>\n  kable(digits = 3)\n\n\n\n\nestimate\nconf.low\nconf.high\nstatistic\nparameter\n\n\n\n\n0.855\n0.82\n0.886\n395\n462\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21.3.3 The Score approach\n\nm_score <- mosaic::binom.test(x = 395, n = 462,\n                              conf.level = 0.95,\n                              ci.method = \"Score\")\n\nm_score\n\n\n    Exact binomial test (Score CI without continuity correction)\n\ndata:  395 out of 462\nnumber of successes = 395, number of trials = 462, p-value < 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.5\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.8199415 0.8841607\nsample estimates:\nprobability of success \n             0.8549784 \n\n\nThe Score approach is also used by stats::prop.test() and creates CIs by inverting p-values from score tests. It can be applied with a continuity correction (use ci.method = “prop.test”) or without.\nIn this case, we see that the Score approach and the Clopper-Pearson approach give very similar results.\n\ntidy(m_score) |> \n  select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high, statistic, parameter) |>\n  kable(digits = 3)\n\n\n\n\nestimate\nconf.low\nconf.high\nstatistic\nparameter\n\n\n\n\n0.855\n0.82\n0.884\n395\n462\n\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned, the score test can also be run incorporating something called a continuity correction, since we are using a Normal approximation to the exact binomial distribution to establish our margin for error. R, by default, includes this continuity correction for the Score test when we use prop.test to collect it.\n\nm_score_cor <- mosaic::binom.test(x = 395, n = 462,\n                                  conf.level = 0.95,\n                                  ci.method = \"prop.test\")\n\nm_score_cor\n\n\n    Exact binomial test (Score CI with continuity correction)\n\ndata:  395 out of 462\nnumber of successes = 395, number of trials = 462, p-value < 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.5\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.8187706 0.8851359\nsample estimates:\nprobability of success \n             0.8549784 \n\n\n\ntidy(m_score_cor) |> \n  select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high, statistic, parameter) |>\n  kable(digits = 3)\n\n\n\n\nestimate\nconf.low\nconf.high\nstatistic\nparameter\n\n\n\n\n0.855\n0.819\n0.885\n395\n462\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21.3.4 The Agresti-Coull Approach\n\nm_agresti <- mosaic::binom.test(x = 395, n = 462,\n                                conf.level = 0.95,\n                                ci.method = \"agresti-coull\")\n\nm_agresti\n\n\n    Exact binomial test (Agresti-Coull CI)\n\ndata:  395 out of 462\nnumber of successes = 395, number of trials = 462, p-value < 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.5\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.8198094 0.8842928\nsample estimates:\nprobability of success \n             0.8549784 \n\n\nThe Agresti-Coull approach is the Wald method after adding Z successes and Z failures to the data, where Z is the appropriate quantile for a standard Normal distribution (1.96 for a 95% CI).\n\ntidy(m_agresti) |> \n  select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high, statistic, parameter) |>\n  kable(digits = 3)\n\n\n\n\nestimate\nconf.low\nconf.high\nstatistic\nparameter\n\n\n\n\n0.855\n0.82\n0.884\n395\n462\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21.3.5 The “Plus 4” approach\nThis approach is just the Wald method after adding 2 successes and 2 failures (so 4 observations) to the data.

The next subsection describes the R code for calculating the relevant confidence interval.\nAn approach I like for the estimation of a confidence interval for a single population proportion/rate is to estimate the lower bound of a confidence interval with an imaginary failure added to the observed data, and estimate the upper bound of a confidence interval with an imaginary success added to the data.\nSuppose we have X successes in n trials, and we want to establish a confidence interval for the population proportion of successes.\nLet \\(p_1 = (X+0)/(n+1), p_2 = (X+1)/(n+1), q_1 = 1 - p_1, q_2 = 1 - p_2\\)\n\nThe lower bound of a 100(1-\\(\\alpha\\))% confidence interval for the population proportion of successes using the SAIFS procedure is then \\(LB_{SAIFS}(x,n,\\alpha) = p_1 - t_{\\alpha/2, n-1}\\sqrt{\\frac{p_1 q_1}{n}}\\)\nThe upper bound of that same 100(1-\\(\\alpha\\))% confidence interval for the population proportion of successes using the SAIFS procedure is \\(UB_{SAIFS}(x,n,\\alpha) = p_2 + t_{\\alpha/2, n-1}\\sqrt{\\frac{p_2 q_2}{n}}\\)\n\nReturning to the serum zinc example, we’ve got 395 “successes” (value in the normal range) out of 462 “trials” (values measured), so that X = 395 and n = 462\nSo we have \\(p_1 = \\frac{X + 0}{n + 1} = \\frac{395}{463} = 0.8531\\), \\(p_2 = \\frac{X + 1}{n + 1} = \\frac{396}{463} = 0.8553\\), and \\(q_1 = 1 - p_1 = 0.1469\\) and \\(q_2 = 1 - p_2 = 0.1447\\)\nWe have \\(n = 462\\) so if we want a 95% confidence interval (\\(\\alpha = 0.05\\)), then we have \\(t_{\\alpha/2, n-1} = t_{0.025, 461} = 1.9651\\), which I determined using R’s qt function:\n\nqt(0.025, df = 461, lower.tail=FALSE)\n\n[1] 1.965123\n\n\n\nThus, our lower bound for a 95% confidence interval is \\(p_1 - t_{\\alpha/2, n-1}\\sqrt{\\frac{p_1 q_1}{n}}\\), or \\(0.8531 - 1.9651 \\sqrt{\\frac{0.8531(0.1469)}{462}}\\), which is 0.8531 - 0.0324 or 0.8207.\nOur upper bound is \\(p_2 + t_{\\alpha/2, n-1}\\sqrt{\\frac{p_2 q_2}{n}}\\), or \\(0.8553 - 1.9651 \\sqrt{\\frac{0.8553(0.1447)}{462}}\\), which is 0.8553 + 0.0323, or 0.8876.\n\nSo the 95% SAIFS confidence interval estimate for the population proportion, \\(\\pi\\), of teenage males whose serum zinc levels fall within the “normal range” is (0.821, 0.888).\n\n\n21.3.7 A Function in R to Calculate the SAIFS Confidence Interval\nI built an R function, called saifs.ci and contained in the Markdown for this document as well as the Love-boost.R script on the web site, which takes as its arguments a value for X = the number of successes, n = the number of trials, and conf.level = the confidence level, and produces the sample proportion, the SAIFS lower bound and upper bound for the specified two-sided confidence interval for the population proportion, using the equations above.\nHere, for instance, are 95%, 90% and 99% confidence intervals for the population proportion \\(\\pi\\) that we have been studying in the serum zinc data.\n\nsaifs.ci(x = 395, n = 462)\n\nSample Proportion             0.025             0.975 \n            0.855             0.821             0.887 \n\nsaifs.ci(x = 395, n = 462, conf=0.9)\n\nSample Proportion              0.05              0.95 \n            0.855             0.826             0.882 \n\nsaifs.ci(x = 395, n = 462, conf=0.99, dig=5)\n\nSample Proportion             0.005             0.995 \n          0.85498           0.81054           0.89763 \n\n\nNote that in the final interval, I asked the machine to round to five digits rather than the default of three. On my desktop (and probably yours), doing so results in this output:\nSample Proportion             0.005             0.995 \n          0.85498           0.81054           0.89763 \nI’ve got some setting wrong in my bookdown work so that this doesn’t show up above when the function is called.

    "text": "21.4 A Second Example: Ebola Mortality Rates through 9 Months of the Epidemic\nThe World Health Organization’s Ebola Response Team published an article in the October 16, 2014 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, which contained some data I will use in this example, focusing on materials from their Table 2.\nAs of September 14, 2014, a total of 4,507 confirmed and probable cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) had been reported from West Africa. In our example, we will look at a set of 1,737 cases, with definitive outcomes, reported in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone.\nAcross these 1,737 cases, a total of 1,229 cases led to death. Based on these sample data, what can be said about the case fatality rate in the population of EVD cases with definitive outcomes for this epidemic?\n\n21.4.1 Working through the Ebola Virus Disease Example\nWe have n = 1,737 subjects, of whom we observed death in 1,229, for a sample proportion of \\(p = \\frac{1229}{1737} = 0.708\\). The standard error of that sample proportion will be\n\\(SE(p) = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.708(1-0.708)}{1737}} = 0.011\\)\nAnd our 95% confidence interval (so that we’ll use \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05) for the true population proportion, \\(\\pi\\), of EVD cases with definitive outcomes, who will die is \\(p \\pm Z_{.025} \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\\), or 0.708 \\(\\pm\\) 1.96(0.011) = \\(0.708 \\pm 0.022\\), or (0.686, 0.730)\nNote that I simply recalled from our prior work that \\(Z_{0.025} = 1.96\\), but we can verify this:\n\nqnorm(0.025, lower.tail=FALSE)\n\n[1] 1.959964\n\n\nSince both np=(1737)(0.708)=1230 and n(1-p)=(1737)(1-0.708)=507 are substantially greater than 5, this should be a reasonably accurate confidence interval.\nWe have 95% confidence in an interval estimate for the true population proportion that falls between 0.686 and 0.730. Equivalently, we could say that we’re 95% confident that the true case fatality rate expressed as a percentage rather than a proportion, is between 68.6% and 73.0%.\n\n\n21.4.2 Using R to estimate the CI for our Ebola example\n\nebola_wald <- mosaic::binom.test(x = 1229, n = 1737, conf.level = 0.95,\n                                 ci.method = \"Wald\") |>\n  tidy() |> select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high)\nebola_clop <- mosaic::binom.test(x = 1229, n = 1737, conf.level = 0.95,\n                                 ci.method = \"Clopper-Pearson\") |>\n  tidy() |> select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high)\nebola_scor <- mosaic::binom.test(x = 1229, n = 1737, conf.level = 0.95,\n                                 ci.method = \"Score\") |>\n  tidy() |> select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high)\nebola_agco <- mosaic::binom.test(x = 1229, n = 1737, conf.level = 0.95,\n                                 ci.method = \"agresti-coull\") |>\n  tidy() |> select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high)\nebola_plus <- mosaic::binom.test(x = 1229, n = 1737, conf.level = 0.95,\n                                 ci.method = \"plus4\") |>\n  tidy() |> select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high)\n\nebola_res <- bind_rows(ebola_wald, ebola_clop, ebola_scor, \n                       ebola_agco, ebola_plus) |>\n  mutate(approach = c(\"Wald\", \"Clopper-Pearson\", \"Score\",\n                      \"Agresti-Coull\", \"Plus4\"))\n\nebola_res |> kable(digits = 6)\n\n\n\n\nestimate\nconf.low\nconf.high\napproach\n\n\n\n\n0.707542\n0.686150\n0.728934\nWald\n\n\n0.707542\n0.685524\n0.728856\nClopper-Pearson\n\n\n0.707542\n0.685710\n0.728457\nScore\n\n\n0.707542\n0.685705\n0.728462\nAgresti-Coull\n\n\n0.707542\n0.685687\n0.728443\nPlus4\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is way more precision than we can really justify, but I just want you to see that the five results are all (slightly) different.\n\n\n21.4.3 Plotting the Confidence Intervals for the Ebola Virus Disease Example\n\nggplot(ebola_res, aes(x = approach, y = estimate)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +\n    coord_flip() +\n    labs(title = \"95% CIs for x = 1229, n = 1737\")\n\n\n\n\nSo in this case, it really doesn’t matter which one you choose.

    "text": "22.2 A First Example: Ibuprofen and Sepsis Trial\nAs we saw in a previous Chapter, we are interested in comparing the percentage of patients in each arm of the trial (Ibuprofen vs. Placebo) that showed an improvement in their temperature (temp_drop > 0). Our primary interest is in comparing the percentage of Ibuprofen patients whose temperature dropped to the percentage of Placebo patients whose temperature dropped.\n\nWe can summarize the data behind the two proportions we are comparing in a contingency table with two rows which identify the exposure or treatment of interest, and two columns to represent the outcomes of interest.\nIn this case, we are comparing two groups of subjects based on treatment (treat): those who received Ibuprofen and those who received a placebo. The outcome of interest is whether the subject’s temperature dropped (temp_drop > 0), or not.\nIn the table, we place the frequency for each combination of a row and a column.\nThe rows need to be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive: each patient must either receive Ibuprofen or Placebo. Similarly, the columns must meet the same standard: every patient’s temperature either drops or does not drop.\n\nHere’s the contingency table.\n\nsepsis <- read_csv(\"data/sepsis.csv\",\n                   show_col_types = FALSE) |>\n    mutate(treat = factor(treat),\n           race = factor(race))\n\n\nsepsis <- sepsis |>\n    mutate(dropped = ifelse(temp_drop > 0, \"Drop\", \"No Drop\"))\n\nsepsis |> tabyl(treat, dropped) |> \n    adorn_totals() |>\n    adorn_percentages(denom = \"row\") |>\n    adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 1) |>\n    adorn_ns(position = \"front\")\n\n     treat        Drop     No Drop\n Ibuprofen 107 (71.3%)  43 (28.7%)\n   Placebo  80 (53.3%)  70 (46.7%)\n     Total 187 (62.3%) 113 (37.7%)\n\n\nIn our sample, we observe 71.3% of the 150 Ibuprofen subjects with a positive temp_drop as compared to 53.3% of the 150 Placebo subjects. We want to compare these two probabilities (represented using proportions as 0.713 vs. 0.533) to estimate the size of the difference between the proportions with a point estimate and 90% confidence interval.\nBut there are other comparisons we could make, too. The tricky part is that we have multiple ways to describe the relationship between treatment and outcome. We might compare outcome “risks” directly using the difference in probabilities, or the ratio of the two probabilities, or we might convert the risks to odds, and compare the ratio of those odds. In any case, we’ll get different point estimates and confidence intervals, all of which will help us make conclusions about the evidence available in this trial speaking to differences between Ibuprofen and Placebo."

This is sometimes called a Bayesian augmentation.\n\nThe big problem with x / n is that it estimates p = 0 or p = 1 when x = 0 or x = n. \nIt’s also tricky to compute confidence intervals at these extremes, since the usual standard error for a proportion, \\(\\sqrt{n p (1-p)}\\), gives zero, which isn’t quite right.\n(x + 2)/(n + 4) is much cleaner, especially when you build a confidence interval for the rate.\nThe only place where (x + 2)/(n + 4) will go wrong is if n is small and the true probability is very close to 0 or 1.\n\nFor example, if n = 10, and p is 1 in a million, then x will almost certainly be zero, and an estimate of 1/12 is much worse than the simple 0/10. However, how big a deal is this? If p might be 1 in a million, you’re not going to estimate it with a n = 10 experiment.\nApplying this method to our Ibuprofen and Sepsis Trial data, we would simply add two to each frequency in the main four cells in our 2x2 table.\nSo instead of using\n\ntwobytwo(107, 43, 80, 70, \n         \"Ibuprofen\", \"Placebo\", \"Dropped\", \"No Drop\",\n         conf.level = 0.90)\n\nthe Bayesian augmentation would encourage us to look at\n\ntwobytwo(109, 45, 82, 72, \n         \"Ibuprofen\", \"Placebo\", \"Dropped\", \"No Drop\",\n         conf.level = 0.90)\n\n2 by 2 table analysis: \n------------------------------------------------------ \nOutcome   : Dropped \nComparing : Ibuprofen vs. Placebo \n\n          Dropped No Drop    P(Dropped) 90% conf. interval\nIbuprofen     109      45        0.7078    0.6441   0.7643\nPlacebo        82      72        0.5325    0.4662   0.5977\n\n                                   90% conf. interval\n             Relative Risk: 1.3293    1.1434   1.5453\n         Sample Odds Ratio: 2.1268    1.4337   3.1550\nConditional MLE Odds Ratio: 2.1215    1.3950   3.2421\n    Probability difference: 0.1753    0.0845   0.2622\n\n             Exact P-value: 0.0022 \n        Asymptotic P-value: 0.0016 \n------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAs you can see, the odds ratio and relative risk estimates are (a little) closer to 1, and the probability difference is also a little closer to 0. The Bayesian augmentation provides a slightly more conservative set of estimates of the impact of Ibuprofen as compared to Placebo.\nIt is likely that the augmented version is a more accurate estimate here, but the two estimates will be comparable, generally, so long as either (a) the sample size in each exposure group is more than, say, 30 subjects, and/or (b) the sample probability of the outcome is between 10% and 90% in each exposure group."

    "text": "24.5 Three-Way Tables: A 2x2xK Table and a Mantel-Haenszel Analysis\nThe material I discuss in this section is attributable to Jeff Simonoff and his book Analyzing Categorical Data. The example is taken from Section 8.1 of that book.\nA three-dimensional or three-way table of counts often reflects a situation where the rows and columns refer to variables whose association is of primary interest to us, and the third factor (a layer, or strata) describes a control variable, whose effect on our primary association is something we are controlling for in the analysis.\n\n24.5.1 Smoking and Mortality in the UK\nIn the early 1970s and then again 20 years later, in Whickham, United Kingdom, surveys yielded the following relationship between whether a person was a smoker at the time of the original survey and whether they were still alive 20 years later.\n\nwhickham1 <- matrix(c(502, 230, 443, 139), byrow=TRUE, nrow=2)\nrownames(whickham1) <- c(\"Non-Smoker\", \"Smoker\")\ncolnames(whickham1) <- c(\"Alive\", \"Dead\")\naddmargins(whickham1)\n\n           Alive Dead  Sum\nNon-Smoker   502  230  732\nSmoker       443  139  582\nSum          945  369 1314\n\n\nHere’s the two-by-two table analysis.\n\ntwoby2(whickham1)\n\n2 by 2 table analysis: \n------------------------------------------------------ \nOutcome   : Alive \nComparing : Non-Smoker vs. Smoker \n\n           Alive Dead    P(Alive) 95% conf. interval\nNon-Smoker   502  230      0.6858    0.6512   0.7184\nSmoker       443  139      0.7612    0.7248   0.7941\n\n                                    95% conf. interval\n             Relative Risk:  0.9010    0.8427   0.9633\n         Sample Odds Ratio:  0.6848    0.5353   0.8761\nConditional MLE Odds Ratio:  0.6850    0.5307   0.8822\n    Probability difference: -0.0754   -0.1230  -0.0266\n\n             Exact P-value: 0.0030 \n        Asymptotic P-value: 0.0026 \n------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThere is a detectable association between smoking and mortality, but it isn’t the one you might expect.\n\nThe odds ratio is 0.68, implying that the odds of having lived were only 68% as large for non-smokers as for smokers.\nDoes that mean that smoking is good for you?\n\nNot likely. There is a key “lurking” variable here - a variable that is related to both smoking and mortality that is obscuring the actual relationship - namely, age.\n\n\n24.5.2 The whickham data with age, too\nThe table below gives the mortality experience separated into subtables by initial age group.\n\nage <- c(rep(\"18-24\", 4), rep(\"25-34\", 4), \n         rep(\"35-44\", 4), rep(\"45-54\", 4), \n         rep(\"55-64\", 4), rep(\"65-74\", 4), \n         rep(\"75+\", 4))\nsmoking <- c(rep(c(\"Smoker\", \"Smoker\", \"Non-Smoker\", \"Non-Smoker\"), 7))\nstatus <- c(rep(c(\"Alive\", \"Dead\"), 14))\ncounts <- c(53, 2, 61, 1, 121, 3, 152, 5,\n            95, 14, 114, 7, 103, 27, 66, 12,\n            64, 51, 81, 40, 7, 29, 28, 101,\n            0, 13, 0, 64)\n\nwhickham2 <- tibble(smoking, status, age, counts) |>\n    mutate(smoking = factor(smoking),\n           status = factor(status),\n           age = factor(age))\n\n\nwhickham2\n\n# A tibble: 28 × 4\n   smoking    status age   counts\n   <fct>      <fct>  <fct>  <dbl>\n 1 Smoker     Alive  18-24     53\n 2 Smoker     Dead   18-24      2\n 3 Non-Smoker Alive  18-24     61\n 4 Non-Smoker Dead   18-24      1\n 5 Smoker     Alive  25-34    121\n 6 Smoker     Dead   25-34      3\n 7 Non-Smoker Alive  25-34    152\n 8 Non-Smoker Dead   25-34      5\n 9 Smoker     Alive  35-44     95\n10 Smoker     Dead   35-44     14\n# … with 18 more rows\n# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows\n\n\n\nwhick_t2 <- \n    xtabs(counts ~ smoking + status + age, data = whickham2)\n\nwhick_t2\n\n, , age = 18-24\n\n            status\nsmoking      Alive Dead\n  Non-Smoker    61    1\n  Smoker        53    2\n\n, , age = 25-34\n\n            status\nsmoking      Alive Dead\n  Non-Smoker   152    5\n  Smoker       121    3\n\n, , age = 35-44\n\n            status\nsmoking      Alive Dead\n  Non-Smoker   114    7\n  Smoker        95   14\n\n, , age = 45-54\n\n            status\nsmoking      Alive Dead\n  Non-Smoker    66   12\n  Smoker       103   27\n\n, , age = 55-64\n\n            status\nsmoking      Alive Dead\n  Non-Smoker    81   40\n  Smoker        64   51\n\n, , age = 65-74\n\n            status\nsmoking      Alive Dead\n  Non-Smoker    28  101\n  Smoker         7   29\n\n, , age = 75+\n\n            status\nsmoking      Alive Dead\n  Non-Smoker     0   64\n  Smoker         0   13\n\n\nThe sample odds ratios for remaining Alive comparing Non-Smokers to Smokers for each of these subtables (except the last one, where the odds ratio is undefined because of the zero cells) are calculated using the usual cross-product ratio approach, which yields the following results.\n\n\n\nAge Group\nOdds Ratio\n\n\n\n\n18-24\n2.30\n\n\n25-34\n0.75\n\n\n35-44\n2.40\n\n\n45-54\n1.44\n\n\n55-64\n1.61\n\n\n65-74\n1.15\n\n\n75+\nUndefined\n\n\n\nThus, for all age groups except 25-34 year olds, not smoking appears to be associated with higher odds of remaining alive.\nWhy? Not surprisingly, there is a strong association between age and mortality, with mortality rates being very low for young people (2.5% for 18-24 year olds) and increasing to 100% for 75+ year olds.\nThere is also an association between age and smoking, with smoking rates peaking in the 45-54 year old range and then falling off rapidly. In particular, respondents who were 65 and older at the time of the first survey had very low smoking rates (25.4%) but very high mortality rates (85.5%). Smoking was hardly the cause, however, since even among the 65-74 year olds mortality was higher among smokers (80.6%) than it was among non-smokers (78.3%). A flat version of the table (ftable in R) can help us with these calculations.\n\nftable(whick_t2)\n\n                  age 18-24 25-34 35-44 45-54 55-64 65-74 75+\nsmoking    status                                            \nNon-Smoker Alive         61   152   114    66    81    28   0\n           Dead           1     5     7    12    40   101  64\nSmoker     Alive         53   121    95   103    64     7   0\n           Dead           2     3    14    27    51    29  13\n\n\n\n\n24.5.3 Checking Assumptions: The Woolf test\nWe can also obtain a test (using the woolf_test function, in the vcd library) to see if the common odds ratio estimated in the Mantel-Haenszel procedure is reasonable for all age groups. In other words, the Woolf test is a test of the assumption of homogeneous odds ratios across the six age groups.\nIf the Woolf test is significant, it suggests that the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test is not appropriate, since the odds ratios for smoking and mortality vary too much in the sub-tables by age group. Here, we have the following log odds ratios (estimated using conditional maximum likelihood, rather than cross-product ratios) and the associated Woolf test.\n\n## Next two results use the vcd package\nvcd::oddsratio(whick_t2, log = TRUE)\n\nlog odds ratios for smoking and status by age \n\n      18-24       25-34       35-44       45-54       55-64       65-74 \n 0.65018114 -0.22473479  0.84069420  0.34608770  0.47421763  0.09933253 \n        75+ \n-1.56397554 \n\nvcd::woolf_test(whick_t2)\n\n\n    Woolf-test on Homogeneity of Odds Ratios (no 3-Way assoc.)\n\ndata:  whick_t2\nX-squared = 3.2061, df = 6, p-value = 0.7826\n\n\nAs you can see, the Woolf test is not close to our usual standards for statistically detectable results, implying the common odds ratio is at least potentially reasonable for all age groups (or at least the ones under ages 75, where some data are available.)\n\n\n24.5.4 The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Test\nSo, the marginal table looking at smoking and mortality combining all age groups isn’t the most meaningful summary of the relationship between smoking and mortality. Instead, we need to look at the conditional association of smoking and mortality, given age, to address our interests.\nThe null hypothesis would be that, in the population, smoking and mortality are independent within strata formed by age group. In other words, \\(H_0\\) requires that smoking be of no value in predicting mortality once age has been accounted for.\nThe alternative hypothesis would be that, in the population, smoking and mortality are associated within the strata formed by age group. In other words, \\(H_A\\) requires that smoking be of at least some value in predicting mortality even after age has been accounted for.\nWe can consider the evidence that helps us choose between these two hypotheses with a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, which is obtained in R through the mantelhaen.test function. This test requires us to assume that, in the population and within each age group, the smoking-mortality odds ratio is the same. Essentially, this means that the association of smoking with mortality is the same for older and younger people.\n\nmantelhaen.test(whick_t2, conf.level  = 0.90)\n\n\n    Mantel-Haenszel chi-squared test with continuity correction\n\ndata:  whick_t2\nMantel-Haenszel X-squared = 5.435, df = 1, p-value = 0.01974\nalternative hypothesis: true common odds ratio is not equal to 1\n90 percent confidence interval:\n 1.143198 2.041872\nsample estimates:\ncommon odds ratio \n          1.52783 \n\n\n\nThe Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test statistic is a bit larger than 5 (after a continuity correction) leading to a p value of 0.02, indicating strong rejection of the null hypothesis of conditional independence of smoking and survival given age.\nThe estimated common conditional odds ratio is 1.53. This implies that (adjusting for age) being a non-smoker is associated with 53% higher odds of being alive 20 years later than being a smoker.\nA 90% confidence interval for that common odds ratio is (1.14, 2.04), reinforcing rejection of the null hypothesis of conditional independence (where the odds ratio would be 1).\n\n\n\n24.5.5 Without the Continuity Correction\nBy default, R presents the Mantel-Haenszel test with a continuity correction, when used for a 2x2xK table. In virtually all cases, go ahead and do this, but as you can see below, the difference it makes in this case is modest.\n\nmantelhaen.test(whick_t2, correct=FALSE, conf.level = 0.90)\n\n\n    Mantel-Haenszel chi-squared test without continuity correction\n\ndata:  whick_t2\nMantel-Haenszel X-squared = 5.8443, df = 1, p-value = 0.01563\nalternative hypothesis: true common odds ratio is not equal to 1\n90 percent confidence interval:\n 1.143198 2.041872\nsample estimates:\ncommon odds ratio \n          1.52783"

    "text": "25.4 Alternative Procedures for Comparing More Than Two Means\nNow, if we only had two independent samples, we’d be choosing between a pooled t test, a Welch t test, and a non-parametric procedure like the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank sum test, or even perhaps a bootstrap alternative.\nIn the case of more than two independent samples, we have methods analogous to the Welch test, and the rank sum test, and even the bootstrap, but we’re going to be far more likely to select the analysis of variance (ANOVA) or an equivalent regression-based approach. These are the extensions of the pooled t test. Unless the sample outcome data are very clearly not Normally distributed, and no transformation is available which makes them appear approximately Normal in all of the groups we are comparing, we will stick with ANOVA.\n\n25.4.1 Extending the Welch Test to > 2 Independent Samples\nIt is possible to extend the Welch two-sample t test (not assuming equal population variances) into an analogous one-factor analysis for comparing population means based on independent samples from more than two groups.\nIf we want to compare the population mean GMQ levels across those three income groups without assuming equal population variances, oneway.test is up to the task. The hypotheses being tested here are:\n\nH0: All three means are the same vs.\nHA: At least one of the population means is different than the others.\n\n\noneway.test(GMQ ~ income.cat3, data = nyfs2a)\n\n\n    One-way analysis of means (not assuming equal variances)\n\ndata:  GMQ and income.cat3\nF = 0.3416, num df = 2.00, denom df = 184.41, p-value = 0.7111\n\n\nWe get a p value, but this isn’t much help, though, because we don’t have any measure of effect size, nor do we have any confidence intervals. Like the analogous Welch t test, this approach allows us to forego the assumption of equal population variances in each of the three income groups, but it still requires us to assume that the populations are Normally distributed.\nThat said, most of the time when we have more than two levels of the factor of interest, we won’t bother worrying about the equal population variance assumption, and will just use the one-factor ANOVA approach (with pooled variances) described below, to make the comparisons of interest.\n\n\n25.4.2 Extending the Rank Sum Test to > 2 Independent Samples\nIt is also possible to extend the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney two-sample test into an analogous one-factor analysis called the Kruskal-Wallis test for comparing population measures of location based on independent samples from more than two groups.\nIf we want to compare the centers of the distributions of population GMQ score across our three income groups without assuming Normality, we can use kruskal.test.\nThe hypotheses being tested here are still as before, but for a measure of location other than the population mean\n\nkruskal.test(GMQ ~ income.cat3, data = nyfs2a)\n\n\n    Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  GMQ by income.cat3\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 2.3202, df = 2, p-value = 0.3135\n\n\nAgain, note that this isn’t much help, though, because we don’t have any measure of effect size, nor do we have any confidence intervals.\nThat said, most of the time when we have more than two levels of the factor of interest, we won’t bother worrying about potential violations of the Normality assumption unless they are glaring, and will just use the usual one-factor ANOVA approach (with pooled variances) described below, to make the comparisons of interest.\n\n\n25.4.3 Can we use the bootstrap to compare more than two means?\nSure. There are both ANOVA and ANCOVA analogues using the bootstrap, and in fact, there are power calculations based on the bootstrap, too.

    "text": "25.6 Interpreting the ANOVA Table\n\n25.6.1 What are we Testing?\nThe null hypothesis for the ANOVA table is that the population means of the outcome across the various levels of the factor of interest are all the same, against a two-sided alternative hypothesis that the level-specific population means are not all the same.\nSpecifically, if we have a grouping factor with k levels, then we are testing:\n\nH0: All k population means are the same.\nHA: At least one of the population means is different from the others.\n\n\n\n25.6.2 Elements of the ANOVA Table\nThe ANOVA table breaks down the variation in the outcome explained by the k levels of the factor of interest, and the variation in the outcome which remains (the Residual, or Error).\nSpecifically, the elements of the ANOVA table are:\n\nthe degrees of freedom (labeled Df) for the factor of interest and for the Residuals\nthe sums of squares (labeled Sum Sq) for the factor of interest and for the Residuals\nthe mean square (labeled Mean Sq) for the factor of interest and for the Residuals\nthe ANOVA F test statistic (labeled F value), which is used to generate\nthe p value for the comparison assessed by the ANOVA model, labeled Pr(>F)\n\n\n\n25.6.3 The Degrees of Freedom\n\nanova(lm(GMQ ~ income.cat3, data = nyfs2a))\n\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nResponse: GMQ\n             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)\nincome.cat3   2    146  72.848  0.3469 0.7072\nResiduals   277  58174 210.014               \n\n\n\nThe degrees of freedom attributable to the factor of interest (here, Income category) is the number of levels of the factor minus 1. Here, we have three Income categories (levels), so df(income.cat3) = 2.\nThe total degrees of freedom are the number of observations (across all levels of the factor) minus 1. We have 280 GMQ scores in the nyfs2a data, so the df(Total) must be 279, although the Total row isn’t shown by R in its output.\nThe Residual degrees of freedom are the Total df - Factor df. So, here, that’s 279 - 2 = 277.\n\n\n\n25.6.4 The Sums of Squares\n\nanova(lm(GMQ ~ income.cat3, data = nyfs2a))\n\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nResponse: GMQ\n             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)\nincome.cat3   2    146  72.848  0.3469 0.7072\nResiduals   277  58174 210.014               \n\n\n\nThe sum of squares (often abbreviated SS or Sum Sq) represents variation explained.\nThe factor SS is the sum across all levels of the factor of the sample size for the level multiplied by the squared difference between the level mean and the overall mean across all levels. Here, SS(income.cat3) = 146\nThe total SS is the sum across all observations of the square of the difference between the individual values and the overall mean. Here, that is 146 + 58174 = 58320\nResidual SS = Total SS - Factor SS.\nAlso of interest is a calculation called \\(\\eta^2\\), (“eta-squared”), which is equivalent to \\(R^2\\) in a linear model.\n\nSS(Factor) / SS(Total) = the proportion of variation in our outcome (here, GMQ) explained by the variation between groups (here, income groups)\nIn our case, \\(\\eta^2\\) = 146 / (146 + 58174) = 146 / 58320 = 0.0025\nSo, Income Category alone accounts for about 0.25% of the variation in GMQ levels observed in these data.\n\n\n\n\n25.6.5 The Mean Square\n\nanova(lm(GMQ ~ income.cat3, data = nyfs2a))\n\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nResponse: GMQ\n             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)\nincome.cat3   2    146  72.848  0.3469 0.7072\nResiduals   277  58174 210.014               \n\n\n\nThe Mean Square is the Sum of Squares divided by the degrees of freedom, so MS(Factor) = SS(Factor)/df(Factor).\nIn our case, MS(income.cat3) = SS(income.cat3)/df(income.cat3) = 146 / 2 = 72.848 (notice that R maintains more decimal places than it shows for these calculations) and\nMS(Residuals) = SS(Residuals) / df(Residuals) = 58174 / 277 = 210.014.\n\nMS(Residuals) or MS(Error) is an estimate of the residual variance which corresponds to \\(\\sigma^2\\) in the underlying linear model for the outcome of interest, here GMQ.\n\n\n\n\n25.6.6 The F Test Statistic and p Value\n\nanova(lm(GMQ ~ income.cat3, data = nyfs2a))\n\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nResponse: GMQ\n             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)\nincome.cat3   2    146  72.848  0.3469 0.7072\nResiduals   277  58174 210.014               \n\n\n\nThe ANOVA F test is obtained by calculating MS(Factor) / MS(Residuals).

    "text": "25.11 The Problem of Multiple Comparisons\n\nSuppose we compare High to Low, using a test with \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05\nThen we compare Middle to Low on the same outcome, also using \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05\nThen we compare High to Middle, also with \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05\n\nWhat is our overall \\(\\alpha\\) level across these three comparisons?\n\nIt could be as bad as 0.05 + 0.05 + 0.05, or 0.15.\nRather than our nominal 95% confidence, we have something as low as 85% confidence across this set of simultaneous comparisons.\n\n\n25.11.1 The Bonferroni solution\n\nSuppose we compare High to Low, using a test with \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05/3\nThen we compare Middle to Low on the same outcome, also using \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05/3\nThen we compare High to Middle, also with \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05/3\n\nThen across these three comparisons, our overall \\(\\alpha\\) can be (at worst)\n\n0.05/3 + 0.05/3 + 0.05/3 = 0.05\nSo by changing our nominal confidence level from 95% to 98.333% in each comparison, we wind up with at least 95% confidence across this set of simultaneous comparisons.\nThis is a conservative (worst case) approach.\n\nGoal: Simultaneous comparisons of White vs AA, AA vs Other and White vs Other\n\npairwise.t.test(nyfs2a$GMQ, nyfs2a$income.cat3, p.adjust=\"bonferroni\")\n\n\n    Pairwise comparisons using t tests with pooled SD \n\ndata:  nyfs2a$GMQ and nyfs2a$income.cat3 \n\n                   Low (below 25K) Middle (25 - 64K)\nMiddle (25 - 64K)  1               -                \nHigh (65K or more) 1               1                \n\nP value adjustment method: bonferroni \n\n\nThese p values are very large.\n\n\n25.11.2 Pairwise Comparisons using Tukey’s HSD Method\nGoal: Simultaneous (less conservative) confidence intervals and p values for our three pairwise comparisons (High vs. Low, High vs. Middle, Middle vs. Low)\n\nTukeyHSD(aov(GMQ ~ income.cat3, data = nyfs2a))\n\n  Tukey multiple comparisons of means\n    95% family-wise confidence level\n\nFit: aov(formula = GMQ ~ income.cat3, data = nyfs2a)\n\n$income.cat3\n                                           diff       lwr      upr     p adj\nMiddle (25 - 64K)-Low (below 25K)    -1.6639456 -6.649518 3.321627 0.7116745\nHigh (65K or more)-Low (below 25K)   -1.3023514 -6.259595 3.654892 0.8098084\nHigh (65K or more)-Middle (25 - 64K)  0.3615942 -4.701208 5.424396 0.9845073\n\n\n\n\n25.11.3 Plotting the Tukey HSD results\n\nplot(TukeyHSD(aov(GMQ ~ income.cat3, data = nyfs2a)))\n\n\n\n\nNote that the default positioning of the y axis in the plot of Tukey HSD results can be problematic. If we have longer names, in particular, for the levels of our factor, R will leave out some of the labels. We can alleviate that problem either by using the fct_recode function in the forcats package to rename the factor levels, or we can use the following code to reconfigure the margins of the plot.\n\nmar.default <- c(5,6,4,2) + 0.1 # save default plotting margins\n\npar(mar = mar.default + c(0, 12, 0, 0)) \nplot(TukeyHSD(aov(GMQ ~ income.cat3, data = nyfs2a)), las = 2)\n\n\n\npar(mar = mar.default) # return to normal plotting margins"
