# Setting Up R {.unnumbered}

These Notes make extensive use of

-   the statistical [software language R](https://cran.case.edu/), and
-   the development environment [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/),

both of which are free, and you'll need to install them on your machine. Instructions for doing so will be found on [the course website](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/).

If you need a gentle introduction, or if you're just new to R and RStudio and need to learn about them, we encourage you to take a look at [https://moderndive.com/](http://moderndive.com/), which provides an introduction to statistical and data sciences via R at @ModernDive.

## R Markdown

These notes were written using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), which is an amplification of R Markdown (which we'll learn in 431.) [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), like R and RStudio and Quarto, is free and open source.

R Markdown is described as an *authoring framework* for data science, which lets you

-   save and execute R code
-   generate high-quality reports that can be shared with an audience

This description comes from [RStudio's introduction to R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) which provides an overview and quick tour of what's possible with R Markdown.

Another excellent resource to learn more about R Markdown tools is the Communicate section (especially the [R Markdown chapter](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/rmarkdown.html)) of @R4DS.

## R Packages {.unnumbered}

At the start of each chapter that involves R code, I'll present a series of commands I run to set up R to use several packages (libraries) of functions that expand its capabilities, make a specific change to how I want R output to be displayed (that's the `comment = NA` piece) and sets the theme for most graphs to `theme_bw()`. A chunk of code like this will occur near the top of any R Markdown work.

For example, this is the setup for one of our early chapters that loads four packages.

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = NA)

library(palmerpenguins)
library(janitor)
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)

theme_set(theme_bw())
```

You only need to install a package once, but you need to reload it (using the `library()` function) every time you start a new session. I always load the package called `tidyverse` last, since doing so avoids some annoying problems.

## The `Love-boost.R` script {.unnumbered}

In October, when we start Part B of the course, we'll use some special R functions I've gathered for you in a script called `Love-boost`. I'll tell R about that code using the following command...

```{r}
source("data/Love-boost.R")
```

The `Love-boost.R` script includes four functions:

- `bootdif`
- `saifs.ci`
- `twobytwo`
- `retrodesign`

## Packages Used in these Notes {.unnumbered}

A list of all R packages we want you to install this semester (which includes some packages not included in these Notes) is maintained at [our course web site](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/).

### The `tidyverse`

The `tidyverse` package is actually a meta-package which includes the following core packages:

- `ggplot2` for creating graphics
- `dplyr` for data manipulation
- `tidyr` for creating tidy data
- `readr` for reading in rectangular data
- `purrr` for working with functions and vectors
- `tibble` for creating tibbles - lazy, surly data frames
- `stringr` for working with data strings
- `forcats` for solving problems with factors

Loading the tidyverse with `library(tidyverse)` loads those eight packages.

Installing the tidyverse also installs several other useful packages on your machine, like `glue` and `lubridate`, for example. Read more about the `tidyverse` at [https://www.tidyverse.org/](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
